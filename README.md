## üõ†Ô∏è Workflow  

### **Step 1: Image Input**
- Users upload an image or video to the system.
- **Prompt Example:** "Identify the mood of this image."

### **Step 2: Vision Model Analysis**
- A vision reasoning model (e.g., LLaVA) processes the uploaded media to classify its mood.
- **Output Example:**  
  - Mood: *Calm and Reflective*  
  - Features: **Low Valence (0.3)**, **Low Energy (0.2)**  

### **Step 3: Querying Database for the song**
- The system queries a database containing metadata for songs.  
- The database includes features like valence, energy, tempo and lyrics for each song.

### **Step 4: Generating Top Recommendations**
- Songs matching the specified feature range are retrieved from the database.  
- The system ranks songs based on similarity to the mood features and selects the top 10 recommendations.

### **Step 5: Spotify Integration**
- Users authenticate their Spotify account.  
- Recommendations are refined further by cross-referencing the user's listening history, playlists, and preferences.

### **Step 6: Final Output**
- The system presents a list of recommended songs tailored to the uploaded media's mood and user preferences.  
- Users can integrate these recommendations into their Instagram posts or stories seamlessly.
