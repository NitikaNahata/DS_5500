Do you know what's worth fightin' for
When it's not worth dyin' for?
Does it take your breath away
And you feel yourself suffocatin'?
Does the pain weigh out the pride
And you look for a place to hide?
Did someone break your heart inside?
You're in ruins


One, twenty-one guns
Lay down your arms, give up the fight
One, twenty-one guns
Throw up your arms into the sky
You and I


When you're at the end of the road
And you lost all sense of control
And your thoughts have taken their toll
When your mind breaks the spirit of your soul
Your faith walks on broken glass
And the hangover doesn't pass
Nothing's ever built to last

I just don't wanna see myself anymore, I don't
They, like, they say they miss me and shit, shut up, for real, like, man
Look, 'kay


DJ, run it back, play my song in this bitch
Vibin' like I'm alone in this bitch, mm
Tit for tat, I got you back, was I wrong for that shit?
Tell me, is we too grown for that shit? Uh
I wanna lock it in, baby, no weighin' my options
Wanna travel, see the world, gettin' drunk on an island
Wanna settle, start a family, so tell me about it
And you so perfect, baby, don't give nobody that body (Okay)
Social anxiety, I fear
And I done been this way for some years
I don't really get along with my peers
Everything that they do to me is weird
So in a world full of weirdos, fools, and scrubs
Tell me, what is it you're willin' to do for love?
You know it's true that the datin' pool is fucked
Ain't nobody out here, baby, it just be us
And I know, and I know, and I know, and I know a broken heart when I see one
And I feel, and I feel, and I feel, and I feel like I love you more
Did you know? Do you know? Did you know? Do you know I'm a shoulder if you need one?
When I feel what I feel, keep it real, what’s the deal? I'm ready for
Go somewhere we could be alone, you and me alone
I remember bein' twenty-one when my life had just begun
Twenty-two, many things to see and do
Twenty-three, lookin' forward to twenty-four
Is it just me or it ain't no love no more?
Twenty-five, what a time to be alive
Am I getting old? Why do I feel tired?
All the same old things, the same old games
Same old pain, think it's time for a change 'cause
Certain shit ain't like me no more

It don't excite me no more, no

Put it down heavy even though it's lightweight (It's lightweight, yeah, yeah, yeah, ayy)

Go 'til the sunrise (Sunrise)
Done at the same time (Yeah)
But who's countin' the time when we got it for life? (Got it for life)
I know all your favorite spots (Favorite spots)
We can take it from the top (From the top)
You're such a dream come true, true
Make a bitch wanna hit snooze, ooh


Can you stay up all night?
Fuck me 'til the daylight (Yeah, yeah)
Thirty-four, thirty-five (Ah; thirty-four, thirty-five)
Can you stay up all night? (Do you know what that means?)
Fuck me 'til the daylight (Do you know what that means?)

Once, I was seven years old, my mama told me
"Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely"
Once, I was seven years old


It was a big, big world, but we thought we were bigger
Pushing each other to the limits, we were learnin' quicker
By eleven, smokin' herb and drinkin' burnin' liquor
Never rich, so we were out to make that steady figure


Once, I was eleven years old, my daddy told me
"Go get yourself a wife or you'll be lonely"
Once, I was eleven years old


I always had that dream like my daddy before me
So I started writin' songs, I started writin' stories
Something about that glory just always seemed to bore me
'Cause only those I really love will ever really know me


Once, I was twenty years old, my story got told
Before the mornin' sun, when life was lonely
Once, I was twenty years old (Lukas Graham!)
You might also like
I only see my goals, I don't believe in failure
'Cause I know the smallest voices, they can make it major
I got my boys with me, at least those in favor
And if we don't meet before I leave, I hope I'll see you later

Once, I was twenty years old, my story got told
I was writin' 'bout everything I saw before me
Once, I was twenty years old


Soon, we'll be thirty years old, our songs have been sold
We've traveled around the world and we're still roamin'
Soon, we'll be thirty years old


I'm still learnin' about life, my woman brought children for me
So I can sing them all my songs, and I can tell them stories
Most of my boys are with me, some are still out seekin' glory
And some I had to leave behind, my brother, I'm still sorry


Soon, I'll be sixty years old, my daddy got sixty-one
Remember life and then your life becomes a better one
I made a man so happy when I wrote a letter once
I hope my children come and visit once or twice a month

Soon, I'll be sixty years old, will I think the world is cold?
Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me?
Soon, I'll be sixty years old
Soon, I'll be sixty years old, will I think the world is cold?

My baby want a Birkin, she's been tellin' me all night long
Gasoline and groceries, the list goes on and on
This nine-to-five ain't workin', why the hell do I work so hard?
I can't worry 'bout my problems, I can't take 'em when I'm gone, uh


One, here comes the two to the three to the four
Tell 'em "Bring another round," we need plenty more
Two-steppin' on the table, she don't need a dance floor
Oh my, good Lord


Someone pour me up a double shot of whiskey
They know me and Jack Daniеl's got a history
There's a party downtown near 5th Street
Evеrybody at the bar gettin' tipsy


Everybody at the bar gettin' tipsy
Everybody at the bar gettin' tipsy


I've been Boozey since I left
I ain't changin' for a check
Tell my ma I ain't forget (Oh, Lord), I
Woke up drunk at 10 a.m.​

Fuck you and your mom and your sister and your job
And your broke-ass car and that shit you call art
Fuck you and your friends that I'll never see again
Everybody but your dog, you can all fuck off


I swear I meant to mean the best when it ended
Even tried to bite my tongue when you start shit
Now you're textin' all my friends asking questions
They never even liked you in the first place
Dated a girl that I hate for the attention
She only made it two days, what a connection
It's like you'd do anythin' for my affection
You're goin' all about it in the worst ways

Too be-khabar ya saba khabar
Ik din zaraa mere maasoom dil pe gaur kar
Pardon mein main rakh loon tuje
Ki dil tera aa naa jae kaheen ye gair par
Hum bhole hain, sharmile hain
Hum hain zaraa sidhe, maasoom itanee kair kar
Jis din kabhi zid pe ade
Hum aayenge aag ka tera dariyaa tair kar
Abhee kuch dinon se lage mera dil dhut ho jaise nashe mein
Kyun ladkadaae, ye bahake, gae, hai tere har raaste mein
Hai dil pe shaq mera, ise pyaar ho gaya

Man ke shahar chal raat-bhar
Too aur main do musaafir, bhatakate hum phiren
Chal, raaste jahaan le chalem
Sapanon ke phir dariyaaon mein thak ke hum giren
Koyi pyaar kee tarqeeb ho
Nuskhe koyi jo sikhaye to hum bhee sikh len
Ye pyaar hai rahata kahaan?
Koyi humse kahe, us se jaa ke puch le
Main sanbhaaluun paanv, fisal naa jaaoon, naee-naee dosti hai
"zaraa dekh-bhaal, sanbhal ke chalanaa," kah rahee zindagi hai
Hai dil pe shaq mera, ise pyaar ho gaya
Abhee kuch dinon se sunaa hai dil ka rob hee kuch naya hai
Koyi raaj kambakht hai chhupaae, khuda hee jaane ki kya hai

अभी मुझ में कहीं
बाक़ी थोड़ी सी है ज़िंदगी

I know that you say I get mean when I'm drinking, but
Then again, sometimes I get really sweet so
What does it mean if I tell you to go fuck yourself?
Or if I say that you're beautiful to me?


It's affection, always
Ooh, you're gonna see it someday
My attention for you
Even if it's not what you need


Sometimes we talk all night long, we don't shut up
And when it's late, we'll say we're still wide awake so
We love to talk about how you'll come up to visit me
And we'll rent a car and we'll drive upstate


It's affection, always
Ooh, you're gonna see it someday
My attention's on you
Even if it's not what you need


I think of you, I want you too
I'd fall for you

I blew things out of proportion, now you're blue
Put you in jail for something you didn’t do
I pinned your hands behind your back, oh
Thought I had reason to attack, but no


Fighting with a true love is boxing with no gloves
Chemistry 'til it blows up, 'til there’s no us
Why'd I have to break what I love so much?
It's on your face, and I'm to blame, I need to say


Hey, it's all me, in my head

Holy cow, you're the Holy Trin'
Hold me down when a hole need dick
Be my security, it's your therapy
With you, I ain't holding shit back
When I need my space, you give that
When he broke my heart, you fixed that
With a long walk on the beach
Love it when they honk-honk on the street (Beep)
When they see us zoom by in the Jeep (Yeah)
We a whole damn joint, we a energy
Baby, we could just ride on our enemies
They all wanna know how you get to me
Let 'em feel how they feel and be Philistines
'Cause this type of love's the epitome, said


Baby, you're literally capping to me right now
Like why are you capping me?
You just cap so hard, it's— I don't know what to do


Kissin' and hope they caught us (Ah)
Whether they like or not (Not)
I wanna show you off (Off)

I wanna brag about it (Yeah)

Captured effortlessly
That's the way it was
Happened so naturally
I did not know it was love
The next thing I felt was you
Holding me close
What was I gonna do?
I let myself go


And now we're flyin' through the stars
I hope this night will last forever
Oh-whoa-oh-oh


Ain't nobody
Loves me better
Makes me happy
Makes me feel this way
Ain't nobody
Loves me better than you


I've been waitin' for you
It's been so long
I knew just what I would do
When I heard your song
You filled my heart with a kiss
You gave me freedom
You knew I could not resist
I needed someone

Let's make this fleeting moment last forever
So, tell me what you're waiting for?
I'm gonna keep it frozen here forever
There's no regretting anymore
It's worth the wait, even so far away
I'm making the night mine until the day I die
No light to brake when you're hanging by fate
You know what it feels like when you're dancing blind


All alone, just the beat inside my soul
Take me home, where my dreams are made of gold
In the zone, where the beat is uncontrolled
I know what it feels like
Come on, make me feel alive

Meet me under shining lights
I've been waiting right here all my life

You can't deny that you're living, open up your eyes
And I just wanna sink into your crazy laughter
Come on, make me feel until the pain don't matter
Every second here makes my heart beat faster

What would I do without your smart mouth?
Drawing me in and you kicking me out
You've got my head spinning, no kidding
I can't pin you down
What's goin' on in that beautiful mind?
I'm on your magical mystery ride
And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me
But I'll be alright


My head's under water, but I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind


'Cause all of me loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me, I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose, I'm winning


'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh-oh
You might also like
How many times do I have to tell you?
Even when you're crying, you're beautiful, too
The world is beating you down, I'm around
Through every mood
You're my downfall, you're my muse
My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues
I can't stop singing, it's ringing
In my head for you


My head's under water, but I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind


'Cause all of me loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges

Give your all to me, I'll give my all to you

Risking it all, though it's hard

Eu não posso negar que fico mais estiloso com você
Não posso negar que fico chapado com você (Não posso negar que fico chapado)

Eu tô me sentindo melhor, sabia que era você (Oh yeah)
Você tá tentando ir embora, tenho um ataque de asma
Os momentos que passamos, vamos valorizar isso
Mudo o clima, eu tô muito relaxado
Entrei no quarto, vi uma estrela no teto
Sentamos numa ilha, estamos tranquilos, estamos relaxando
Você me fez pensar em comprar o prédio
Não existem mais preocupações, esse é o nosso resort
Tô tentando ser modesto, você tá me fazendo gastar
Essa mina não fuma, mas ela bola meus baseados
Você me mantém carregado, mantenha sua palavra como se fosse um vínculo
Não existem mais problemas, eles exageraram
Você me deu vida quando meu coração tava entorpecido
Eu preciso cantar uma música pra você ou algo assim (Cantar uma música pra você, la-la-la-la-la-la-la)

I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But somethin' 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now


Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singin' in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days


And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh


'Causе there we arе again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well


Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turnin' red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me
And you were tossing me the car keys, "Fuck the patriarchy"
Keychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town
And I was thinkin' on the drive down, "Any time now
He's gonna say it's love," you never called it what it was
'Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame
You might also like
And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to


'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well
And there we are again when nobody had to know
You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath
Sacred prayer and we'd swear
To remember it all too well, yeah


Well, maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
Runnin' scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of bein' honest
I'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all

They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new hell
Every time you double-cross my mind
You said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would've been fine
And that made me want to die
The idea you had of me, who was she?
A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
Not weepin' in a party bathroom
Some actress askin' me what happened, you
That's what happened, you
You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
Sippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show
But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin' you to come
And he said, "It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one"


Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still tryin' to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah


'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well

And I was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes
"I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age"
From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight
And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?
Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?
'Cause in this city's barren cold
I still remember the first fall of snow
And how it glistened as it fell
I remember it all too well


Just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?
Just between us, do you remember it all too well?
Just between us, I remember it (Just between us) all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (I was there)
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (Oh)
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there (I was there)
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it (All too well)
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it227Embed

I walked through the door with you, the air was cold

And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now


Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singin' in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days


And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh


'Causе there we arе again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well


Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turnin' red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me
And you were tossing me the car keys, "Fuck the patriarchy"
Keychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town
And I was thinkin' on the drive down, "Any time now
He's gonna say it's love," you never called it what it was
'Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame


And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to


'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well
And there we are again when nobody had to know
You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath
Sacred prayer and we'd swear
To remember it all too well, yeah


Well, maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
Runnin' scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of bein' honest
I'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all


They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new hell
Every time you double-cross my mind
You said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would've been fine
And that made me want to die
The idea you had of me, who was she?
A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
Not weepin' in a party bathroom
Some actress askin' me what happened, you
That's what happened, you
You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
Sippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show
But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin' you to come
And he said, "It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one"


Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still tryin' to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah


'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well


And I was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes
"I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age"
From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight
And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?
Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?
'Cause in this city's barren cold
I still remember the first fall of snow
And how it glistened as it fell
I remember it all too well


Just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?
Just between us, do you remember it all too well?
Just between us, I remember it (Just between us) all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (I was there)
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (Oh)
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there (I was there)
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it (All too well)
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it","['nostalgia', 'sadness', 'adventure']"

Fighting flames with fire
Hang onto burning wires

Are we fading lovers?
We keep wasting colors
Maybe we should let this go

We're falling apart, still we hold together
We've passed the end, so we chase forever
'Cause this is all we know

I'll ride my bike up to the road
Down the streets right through the city

Remember all the things we wanted
Now all our memories, they're haunted
We were always meant to say goodbye
Even with our fists held high
It never would have worked out right
We were never meant for do or die


I didn't want us to burn out, I
I didn't come here to hurt you, now I can't stop


I want you to know that it doesn't matter
Where we take this road, but someone's gotta go
And I want you to know, you couldn't have loved me better
But I want you to move on, so I'm already gone


Looking at you makes it harder
But I know that you'll find another
That doesn't always make you wanna cry
It started with a perfect kiss then we could feel the poison set in
Perfect couldn't keep this love alive

I love you enough to let you go

I thought about our last kiss, how it felt, the way tasted
And even though your friends tell me your doin' fine
Are you somewhere feeling lonely even though he's right beside you
When he says those words that hurt you, do you read the ones I wrote you?
Sometimes I start to wonder; was it just a lie?
If what we had was real, how could you be fine?
'Cause I'm not fine at all...
I remember the day you told me you were leaving
I remember the makeup runnin' down your face
And the dreams you left behind you didn't need them
Like every single wish we ever made
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia

Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape;

It's hard to hear your name when I haven't seen you in so long
It's like we never happened, what is just a lie?
If what we had was real, how could you be fine?
'Cause I'm not fine at all...
I remember the day you told me you were leaving
I remember the makeup runnin' down your face
And the dreams you left behind, you didn't need them
Like every-single wish we ever made
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape
If today I woke up with you right beside me
Like all of this was just some twisted dream;
I'd hold you closer than I ever did before
And you'd never slip away, you'd never hear me say:
I remember the day you told me you were leaving
I remember the makeup runnin' down your face
And the dreams you left behind, you didn't need them

I drove by all the places we used to hang out getting wasted
I thought about our last kiss, how it felt, the way tasted
And even though your friends tell me your doin' fine
Are you somewhere feeling lonely even though he's right beside you
When he says those words that hurt you, do you read the ones I wrote you?
Sometimes I start to wonder; was it just a lie?
If what we had was real, how could you be fine?

I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift, all of the people
I've ghosted stand there in the room


I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis
(Tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tired of my scheming
(For the last time)


It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero


Sometimes, I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And I'm a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart, but never killed

I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money

Você tem me perguntado, mas eu não tenho uma resposta
"Como assim?"
Eu ainda estou pensando, vamos fingir que estamos adormecendo agora
Quando ficarmos mais velhos, vamos nos arrepender disso?
Jovens demais para pensar em toda essa merda
E estagnar só serve para alguma coisa quando você tem uma vantagem inicial


Porque nós poderíamos ficar em casa ou assistir ao pôr do sol
Mas eu não posso deixar de perguntar, "você já está entediada?"
E se você está se sentindo sozinha, você deveria me dizer
Antes que isso termine como mais uma memória
Você vai dizer a verdade, para que eu não tenha que mentir?

Gravity's holdin' me back
I want you to hold out the palm of your hand
Why don't we leave it at that?

When everything gets in the way
Seems you cannot be replaced

Why are you sitting at home on the floor?

Ringin' the bell

Baby, come back
Any kind of fool could see
There was somethin' in everything about you
Baby, come back
You could blame it all on me
I was wrong, and I just can't live without you
Baby, come back


It's been a crazy last year, I'm tryna process still
I don't even know how I should feel
I got a couple big houses and some whips, maybe three
And I got family members that got bigger egos than me
And I got fans around the world whenever I'm overseas
And I got friends who just pretend and say they love everything
And yes, I fell in love again, I thought that shit was impossible
And I promise it's too rеal for me to care what they think
I promisе I don't give a fuck because I know who I am
Hatin' on me undercover, I just won't understand
Say we're brothers, call me family, but you act like a fan
2 a.m. in Atlanta, screamin', "Baby, I'm back" (Aw, yeah)


Played me like a fool, I see
But it's been so long since I've thought about you
I swear, okay, baby, I'm back
I guess you weren't the one for me
But it's been so long since I've thought about you
I swear, okay, baby, I'm back

I told my baby, "Let them talk," that's the caption
I don't even really like bein' online, that shit taxin'
Started off as an attraction, now it's turnin' to attachment
Overseas, we relaxin', I ain't thinkin' 'bout the past tense, no
Now everybody wanna say shit, all of a sudden y'all believed in me
All of a sudden you want a favor now, all of a sudden you wan' be with me
All of a sudden y'all always knew, but I remember you ain't see it in me


And yes, I know I'm blessed, but sometimes I wish I could go back
To the way it used to be
Just so I can feel what I've been missin' (Oh, baby, come back)
You can have it all, you see
But there's still somethin' that's not the same about you (Oh-oh, baby, come back)


Baby, come back (Aw, yeah)

And I don't think we can solve them
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we got bad blood, hey


Did you have to do this?
I was thinking that you could be trusted
Did you have to ruin
What was shiny? Now it's all rusted
Did you have to hit me
Where I'm weak? Baby, I couldn't breathe
And rub it in so deep
Salt in the wound like you're laughin' right at me


Oh, it's so sad to

(One, two, three, four)
Ooh, ooh

Every time you come around, you know I can't say no
Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control
I can feel the paradise before my world implodes
And tonight had something wonderful


My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes starin' at space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's truе, it's true
My bad habits lead to you


Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lеad to you

Every pure intention ends when the good times start

It started under neon lights and then it all got dark
I only know how to go too far


My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes starin' at space

Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's true, it's true

Oh, hush, my dear, it's been a difficult year

Trust me, darlin', trust me, darlin'
It’s been a loveless year
I'm a man of three fears
Integrity, faith, and crocodile tears

Perfect paradise, tearin' at the seams
I wish I could escape it, I don't wanna fake it
Wish I could erase it, make your heart believe


But I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, now you know
I'm a bad liar, bad liar

Я не в настроении, потому что мой рейс задержали
Потому я сел на частный самолет и спросил у пилота расчетное время прибытия
Ламбо припаркован на полосе для посадки, все члены моей банды и мой диджей при бабках
Почему мой чувак говорит об ИншаАллахе? В такие времена он даже не молится
Почему на моем чуваке надета цепочка с Иисусом?
Как она влезает в эти джинсы?
Большая жопа и маленькая талия
Не торопитесь с GBG, мы ни с кем не бифимся как GBK
Проснулся не с той стороны кровати, так что его шлёпнут, если сегодня у меня нет моих фунтов
Я люблю своего братишку, я не оставлю его одного, я привязан к Lil' Bro, как PVA
Я уже заработал, мне не нужна никакая хит-песня
Нам не нужен ID, Lil' Bro семнадцать, в клубе, он не скролит TikTok
Он только что увидел одну хорошую: "Какую из? Какую ты хочешь, бро? Выбирай"
Если я попробую, то трахну одну, вопрос времени, когда я их всех сделаю
Ладно


Мы можем идти косарь за косарём, нахуй это, мы можем идти миллион за миллионом
Четверть миллиона за грузовик Maybach, двойная R с заводскими дисками
У меня есть 90-й, Urus, Virgil, Brabus, я правда представляю угрозу
Дошло до того, что мне уже всё равно, у меня в сейфе лежат драгоценности, которые я даже не ношу


Брат сделает это ради обуви и одежды, посмотрим, что он сделает ради цепочки
Грузовик Rari, похожий на паука, ползущего за долларами на одних только аксессуарах (Черт)
Она заставила меня делать еще жестче, мне нравится вся ее аура, кажется, я одержим ею
Они подкараулили его в день рождения, поступили с ним самым ужасным образом, он загадал желание в день смерти
Я проникаю прямо под их кожу, я даже не пытаюсь, наверное, я ничего не могу поделать с этим дерьмом
Я буду любить брата всю жизнь, говорим мы или нет, я шагаю вместе с ними
Конечно, ты можешь превзойти меня в разговоре, не надо ходить туда-сюда, подожди, пока мы его не догоним
Стуча сумкой и сводя с ума всех оппонентов, я влюбился в это
UK Selfridges вместе с крошкой (Ух)
Банковский счет выглядит хорошо, это новый счет (Е)
Ты тот тип, что любит печатать на компьютере (Вау)
У него есть маска, но он не стрелок (Хаха)
Топ-10, но она не ведёт себя нагло
Я и твои подруги можем поехать на Арубу
Поехать во Францию, это зависит от моего настроения
Это Maybach Benz, это не Uber
Мы можем идти косарь за косарём, нахуй это, мы можем идти миллион за миллионом
У мамы тело, как у Ким и остальных
Мама убивала этот спортзал
Мы можем идти часы за часами, от цепи к цепи, кольца, я тот самый
Я разбогател, но я все тот же, приземляюсь в Лондоне и иду в гетто

For a while there, it was rough
But lately, I've been doin' better
Than the last four cold Decembers I recall
And I see my family every month
I found a girl my parents love
She'll come and stay the night, and I think I might have it all
And I thank God every day
For the girl He sent my way
But I know the things He gives me, He can take away
And I hold you every night
And that's a feeling I wanna get used to
But there's no man as terrified as the man who stands to lose you


Oh, I hope I don't losе you
Mm, please stay
I want you, I need you, oh God
Don't take
Thеse beautiful things that I've got

Oh, I'll tell ya, I know I've got enough

If only I'da known you had a storm to weather
So before you go
Was there something I coulda said to make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So before you go


Was never the right time whenever you called
Went little by little by little until there was nothing at all
Our every moment, I start to replay
But all I can think about is seeing that look on your face

Well, time can heal, but this won't

Why the feel for the need to replace me?
You're the wrong way track from the good
I wanna paint a picture tellin' where we could be at

You can give it away, you had it and you took the pay

Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did (Ha)
Haha, time for a little revenge


The story starts when it was hot and it was summer, and
I had it all, I had him right there where I wanted him
She came along, got him alone, and let's hear the applause
She took him faster than you can say "Sabotage"
I never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it
I underestimated just who I was dealing with (Oh)
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
She underestimated just who she was stealin' from


She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, woah
He was a moth to the flame
She was holding the matches, woah
Soon, she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge (Revenge), ha


She looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list
She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it
I think her ever-present frown is a little troubling, and
She thinks I'm psycho 'cause I like to rhyme her name with things
But sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know
Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
They didn't teach you that in prep school so it's up to me
That no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity

Betty, I won't make assumptions
About why you switched your homeroom, but
I think it's 'cause of me
Betty, one time, I was riding on my skateboard
When I passed your house
It's like I couldn't breathe


You heard the rumors from Inez
You can't believe a word she says
Most times, but this time, it was true
The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you


But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me? Would you want me?
Would you tell me to go fuck myself
Or lead me to the garden?
In the garden, would you trust me
If I told you it was just a summer thing?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you


Betty, I know where it all went wrong
Your favorite song was playing
From the far side of the gym
I was nowhere to be found
I hate the crowds, you know that

I was walking home on broken cobblestones
Just thinking of you when she pulled up like
A figment of my worst intentions
She said, "James, get in, let's drive"
Those days turned into nights
Slept next to her, but
I dreamt of you all summer long

Betty, I'm here on your doorstep
And I planned it out for weeks now
But it's finally sinkin' in
Betty, right now is the last time
I can dream about what happens when
You see my face again


The only thing I wanna do
Is make it up to you
So I showed up at your party
Yeah, I showed up at your party


Yeah, I showed up at your party
Will you have me? Will you love me?
Will you kiss me on the porch
In front of all your stupid friends?
If you kiss me, will it be just like I dreamed it?
Will it patch your broken wings?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you

Kissin' in my car again

Maybe I was looking down
When you, the satellite broke through
And left the spec that was our town
And disappeared in fading blue
So when the gravity let go
And all the forces loosened grip
I couldn't help but feel alone
In some way heavier for it

All I know to say


Is it as lonely in between the stars
As I've been back home watching from far away I wonder where you are
And did you look back as you crossed the moon
Do you wonder if I wonder bout you


And so we turn and so it goes
You feel the timing start to slip
We'll meet again one day I hope
Like midnight waves of passing ships

And when you feel the dreams collide

Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there and I thought
"Oh, my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?" Ayy
New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So, hey, let's be friends
I'm dyin' to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames?
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth thе pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tеll you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, mm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name
You might also like
Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the king, baby, I'm your queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come, oh, no
Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessin', like
"Oh, my God, who is she?"
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream


So it's gonna be forever

Young and fine and dark and handsome
The boy from South Detroit keep bossing
And I can't keep my panties from dropping
He's so fly, fly


Going too fast, don't hurt yourself
I can't keep up with all the lies you tell yourself
You kinda cute, but play too much, don't play yourself
I'm not the one, but we can still pretend this can be my man
You say you feel different when you with me, tell me anything
Compliment my energy, it's different laying next to me
All I ask is don't make me pull up and get to dumping
You know I can't give no fucks, you know I'm with all the ruckus, can you?


Young and fine and dark and handsome
The boy West side of Compton camе walking in
I can't keep my panties from dropping
He's so fly, fly


Ooh, he bossy, ooh, hе crip walkin'
Took me to Slauson and he slut me out
And when I got a problem, he get to packing
He 'bout all that action, call him Mr. Handle It
You know I'm hella different from them chickens you been trickin' on
I can be your ride or die, get down your strongest bone
Trust me, boy, I'm good in every hood
Trickin', finna fall in backwards
I'm just tryna show you what it would be like if you my man

Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality
Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low
Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me


Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters


Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooh (Any way the wind blows)
I don't wanna die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

But I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family

Your mouth is a revolver
Firing bullets in the sky
Hmm-hmm
Your love is like a soldier
Loyal till you die
Hmm-hmm


And I've been looking at the stars for a long, long time
I've been putting out fires all my life
Everybody wants a flame
They don't wanna get burnt
And today is our turn


Days like these lead to
Nights like this lead to
Love like ours
You light the spark in my bonfire heart
People like us, we don't
Need that much
Just someone that starts
Starts the spark in our bonfire hearts


This world is getting colder
Strangers passing by
Hmm-hmm
No one offers you a shoulder
No one looks you in the eye, ah-ah

Mmm
I ain't tryna (Ah)
I ain't tryna
I ain't tryna


Yeah, ain't tryna be cool like you
Wobblin' around in your high heel shoes
I'm clumsy, made friends with the floor
Two for one, you know a bitch buy four
And two left feet, you know I always drop
First thing a girl did was a bop
I'm the whole damn cake and the cherry on top
Shook up the bottle, made a good girl pop


You ain't even here to party
Ken in the club, tryna pipe a Barbie
I don't wanna go, go, go with the flow
Backbend 'til I touch my toes
I don't wanna row, row, row the boat
Wrist full of rocks and I hope I float
Big up yourself 'cause you know they don't
I chew, chew, chew 'cause they hope I choke

Buffalo soldier, dreadlock Rasta
There was a Buffalo Soldier in the heart of America
Stolen from Africa, brought to America
Fighting on arrival, fighting for survival
I mean it, when I analyze the stench
To me, it makes a lot of sense
How the dreadlock Rasta
Was a Buffalo Soldier


And he was taken from Africa, brought to America
Fighting on arrival, fighting for survival
Said it was a Buffalo Soldier, dreadlock Rasta
Buffalo Soldier in the heart of America


If you know your history
Then you would know where you're coming from
Then you wouldn't have to ask me
Who the heck do I think I am?


I'm just a Buffalo Soldier in the heart of America
Stolen from Africa, brought to America
Said he was fighting on arrival, fighting for survival
Said he was a Buffalo Soldier, in the war for America

Come out to play when you are hurt?
There's certain things that should be left unsaid
Tick, tick, tick, tick on the watch

I forget how the West was won
I forget if this was ever fun
I just learned these people only raise you
To cage you
Sarahs and Hannahs in their Sunday best
Clutchin' their pearls, sighing, "What a mess"
I just learned these people try and save you
'Cause they hate you


Too high a horse
For a simple girl
To rise above it
They slammed the door
On my whole world
The one thing I wanted


Now I'm runnin' with my dress unbuttoned
Scrеamin', "But, Daddy, I love him"
I'm havin' his baby
No, I'm not, but you should see your faces
I'm tellin' him to floor it through thе fences
No, I'm not coming to my senses
I know he's crazy, but he's the one I want
You might also like
Dutiful daughter, all my plans were laid
Tendrils tucked into a woven braid
Growin' up precocious sometimes means
Not growin' up at all
He was chaos, he was revelry
Bedroom eyes like a remedy
Soon enough, the elders had convened
Down at the city hall


"Stay away from her"
The saboteurs
Protested too much
Lord knows the words
We never heard
Just screeching tires and true love


And I'm runnin' with my dress unbuttoned
Screamin', "But, Daddy, I love him"
I'm havin' his baby
No, I'm not, but you should see your faces
I'm tellin' him to floor it through the fences
No, I'm not coming to my senses
I know he's crazy, but he's the one I want

I'll tell you something right now
I'd rather burn my whole life down
Than listen to one more second of all this bitchin' and moanin'
I'll tell you something 'bout my good name
It's mine alone to disgrace
I don't cater to all these vipers dressed in empath's clothing


God save the most judgmental creeps
Who say they want what's best for me
Sanctimoniously performing soliloquies I'll never see
Thinkin' it can change the beat
Of my heart when he touches me
And counteract the chemistry
And undo the destiny
You ain't gotta pray for me
Me and my wild boy and all of this wild joy
If all you want is gray for me
Then it's just white noise, and it's just my choice


There's a lot of people in town that I
Bestow upon my fakest smiles
Scandal does funny things to pride, but brings lovers closer
We came back when the heat died down
Went to my parents and they came around
All the wine moms are still holdin' out, but fuck 'em, it's over

Now I'm dancin' in my dress in the sun and
Even my daddy just loves him
I'm his lady
And, oh my God, you should see your faces
Time, doesn't it give some perspective?
And, no, you can't come to the wedding
I know it's crazy, but he's the one I want


I'll tell you something right now
You ain't gotta pray for me
Me and my wild boy and all of this wild joy
(He was chaos, he was revelry)
If all you want is gray for me
Then it's just white noise, and it's my choice


Screamin', "But, Daddy, I love him"

No, I'm not

This ain't the first time I've been hostage to these tears
I can't believe I'm finally movin' through my fears
At least I know how hard we tried, both you and me
Didn't we? Didn't we?


So I grab my stuff
Courtney just pulled up in the driveway

You know? I'm stronger than I think
Usually, I'd join you on the floor, but this dance ain't for me
Boy, just turn the music up
Maybe someday, we'll look back with love
Didn't think you'd lose me
Now it's just too late to choose me

My castle crumbled overnight
I brought a knife to a gunfight
They took the crown, but it's alright
All the liars are calling me one
Nobody's heard from me for months
I'm doin' better than I ever was
'Cause


My baby's fit like a daydream
Walkin' with his head down
I'm the one he's walking to
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to
My baby's fly like a jet stream
High above the whole scene
Loves me like I'm brand new
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to


All my flowers grew back as thorns
Windows boarded up after the storm
He built a fire just to keep me warm
All the drama queens taking swings
All the jokers dressing up as kings
They fade to nothing when I look at him
You might also like
And I know I make the same mistakes every time
Bridges burn, I never learn
At least I did one thing right
I did one thing right
I'm laughing with my lover, makin' forts under covers
Trust him like a brother
Yeah, you know I did one thing right
Starry eyes sparkin' up my darkest night


My baby's fit like a daydream
Walkin' with his head down
I'm the one he's walking to
So call it what you want, yeah

So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to


I want to wear his initial on a chain 'round my neck
Chain 'round my neck
Not because he owns me
But 'cause he really knows me
Which is more than they can say, I
I recall late November
Holding my breath, slowly, I said
"You don't need to save me
But would you run away with me?"
Yes (Would you run away?)

My baby's fit like a daydream
Walkin' with his head down
I'm the one he's walking to

You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off of you
You'd be like Heaven to touch
I wanna hold you so much
At long last love has arrived
And I thank God I'm alive
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off you


Pardon the way that I stare
There's nothing else to compare
The sight of you leaves me weak
There are no words left to speak
But if you feel like I feel
Please let me know that it's real
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off you




I love you, baby, and if it's quite alright
I need you, baby, to warm the lonely night
I love you, baby, trust in me when I say
Oh, pretty baby, don't bring me down, I pray
Oh, pretty baby, now that I found you, stay
And let me love you, baby, let me love you

Vintage tee, brand new phone
High heels on cobblestones
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
Sequin smile, black lipstick
Sensual politics
When you are young, they assume you know nothing


But I knew you
Dancin' in your Levi's
Drunk under a streetlight, I
I knew you
Hand under my sweatshirt
Baby, kiss it better, I


And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite


A friend to all is a friend to none
Chase two girls, lose the one
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
You might also like
But I knew you
Playing hide-and-seek and
Giving me your weekends, I
I knew you
Your heartbeat on the High Line
Once in twenty lifetimes, I


And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite


To kiss in cars and downtown bars
Was all we needed
You drew stars around my scars
But now I'm bleedin'


'Cause I knew you
Steppin' on the last train
Marked me like a bloodstain, I
I knew you
Tried to change the ending
Peter losing Wendy, I
I knew you
Leavin' like a father
Running like water, I
And when you are young, they assume you know nothing

But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss
I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs
The smell of smoke would hang around this long
'Cause I knew everything when I was young
I knew I'd curse you for the longest time
Chasin' shadows in the grocery line
I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired
And you'd be standin' in my front porch light
And I knew you'd come back to me
You'd come back to me
And you'd come back to me
And you'd come back

I was in my new house placing daydreams
Patching up the crack along the wall
I pass it and lose track of what I'm saying
'Cause that's where I was when I got the call


When the first stone's thrown, there's screamin'
In the streets, there's a raging riot
When it's "Burn the bitch," they're shrieking
When the truth comes out, it's quiet


So, they killed Cassandra first 'cause she feared the worst
And tried to tell the town
So they filled my cell with snakes, I regret to say
Do you believe me now?


I was in my tower weaving nightmares
Twisting all my smiles into snarls
They say, "What doesn't kill you makes you aware"
What happens if it becomes who you are?


So, they killed Cassandra first 'cause she feared the worst
And tried to tell the town
So they set my life in flames, I regret to say
Do you believe me now?

They knew, they knew, they knew the whole time
That I was onto somethin'
The family, the pure greed, the Christian chorus line
They all said nothin'
Blood's thick, but nothin' like a payroll
Bet they never spared a prayer for my soul
You can mark my words that I said it first
In a mourning warning, no one heard


I patched up the crack along the wall
I pass it and lose track of what I'm saying
'Cause that's where I was when I lost it all


So, they killed Cassandra first 'cause she feared the worst
And tried to tell the town
So they filled my cell with snakes, I regret to say

Ah, ah, ah

Ah, ah

Blood's thick but nothin' like a payroll
Bet they never spared a prayer for my soul
You can mark my words that I said it first
In a mourning warning, no one heard
No one heard, not a single word was heard

Where no one knows me

It's a necessary thing
It's a place I made up
Find out what I'm made of

Counting stars and fighting sleep


Let it wash over me
Ready to lose my feet
Take me off to the place where one reveals life's mystery
Steady on down the line
Lose every sense of time
Take it all in and wake up that small part of me
Day to day I'm blind to see
And find how far
To go

And it flows right through your blood

You booked the night train for a reason
So you could sit there in this hurt
Bustling crowds or silent sleepers
You're not sure which is worse


Because I dropped your hand while dancing
Left you out there standing
Crestfallen on the landing
Champagne problems
Your mom's ring in your pocket
My picture in your wallet
Your heart was glass, I dropped it
Champagne problems


You told your family for a reason
You couldn't keep it in
Your sister splashed out on the bottle
Now no one's celebrating


Dom Pérignon, you brought it
No crowd of friends applauded
Your hometown skeptics called it
Champagne problems
You had a speech, you're speechless
Love slipped beyond your reaches
And I couldn't give a reason
Champagne problems

Your Midas touch on the Chevy door
November flush and your flannel cure
"This dorm was once a madhouse"
I made a joke, "Well, it's made for me"
How evergreen, our group of friends
Don't think we'll say that word again
And soon they'll have the nerve to deck the halls
That we once walked through
One for the money, two for the show
I never was ready so I watch you go
Sometimes you just don't know the answer
'Til someone's on their knees and asks you
"She would've made such a lovely bride
What a shame she's fucked in the head," they said
But you'll find the real thing instead
She'll patch up your tapestry that I shred


And hold your hand while dancing
Never leave you standing
Crestfallen on the landing
With champagne problems

Rolling when you ride, poppin'
Rolling when you ride, ride the Rodman
Got one that's straight acting
Turnt out like some dirty plastic (Ride)

Ah, I met her on my way to Chicago
Where she was all alone
And so was I, so I asked her for her name
She smiled and looked at me
I was surprised to see
That a woman like that was really into me


She said she didn't have no man
Raised the kids the very best she can (She was lovin' me)
She told me she was all alone
Said at home, she didn't have no phone (She was wantin' me)
She said just to give her a page
Fifty-nine was the code she gave (She was lovin' me)
She'd lied to you, lied to me
'Cause she was lovin' me, lovin' me, yeah


I never woulda thought she was livin' like that
Her words seemed so sincere
When I held her near, she would tell me how she feels
It felt so real to me, this girl, she had to be
An angel sent from Heaven just for me


She said she didn’t have no man (Ah, ah)
Raised the kids the very best she can (Look, she's lovin' me)
She told me she was all alone
Said at home, she didn't have no phone (She was lovin' me)
She said just to give her a page
Fifty-nine was the code she gave
She'd lied to you, lied to me
'Cause she was lovin' me, lovin' me, yeah (Look who's lovin' me)
She tried to live a double life
Lovin' me while she was still your wife (She was wantin' me)
She thought that lovin' me was cool
With you at work and the kids at school (She was lovin' me)
She said like it would never end
Tried to keep me any way she can (She was wantin' me)

Your hologram stumbled into my apartment
Hands in the hair of somebody in darkness
Named Chloe or Sam or Sophia or Marcus
And I just watched it happen
As the decade would play us for fools
And you saw my bones out with somebody new
Who seemed like he would've bullied you in school
And you just watched it happen


If you wanna break my cold, cold heart
Just say, "I loved you the way that you were"
If you wanna tear my world apart
Just say you've always wondered


You said some things that I can't unabsorb
You turned me into an idea of sorts
You needed me, but you needed drugs more
And I couldn't watch it happen
I changed into goddesses, villains, and fools
Changed plans and lovers and outfits and rules
All to outrun my desertion of you
And you just watched it
You might also like
If you wanna break my cold, cold heart
Just say, "I loved you the way that you were"
If you wanna tear my world apart
Just say you've always wondered


If the glint in my eye traced the depths of your sigh
Down that passage in time back to the moment
I crashed into you, like so many wrecks do
Too impaired by my youth to know what to do


So if I sell my apartment
And you have some kids with an internet starlet
Will that make your memory fade from this scarlet maroon
Like it never happened?
Could it be enough to just float in your orbit?
Can we watch our phantoms like watching wild horses?
Cooler in theory, but not if you force it to be
It just didn't happen


So if you wanna break my cold, cold heart
Say you loved me
And if you wanna tear my world apart
Say you'll always wonder

'Cause I wonder
Will I always
Will I always wonder?6Embed

Run away, run away

Run away, but we're running in circles

Let go, I got a feeling that it's time to let go
I said so, I knew that this was doomed from the get-go
You thought that it was special, special
But it was just the sex, though, the sex, though
And I still hear the echoes (The echoes)

The drought was the very worst, ah-ah, ah-ah
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
It was months and months of back and forth, ah-ah, ah-ah
You're still all over me like a wine-stained dress I can't wear anymore


Hung my head as I lost the war
And the sky turned black like a perfect storm


The rain came pouring down
When I was drownin', that's when I could finally breathe
And by mornin', gone was any trace of you
I think I am finally clean


There was nothin' left to do, ah-ah, ah-ah
When the butterflies turnеd to dust that covered my whole room
So I punchеd a hole in the roof, ah-ah, ah-ah
Let the flood carry away all my pictures of you


The water filled my lungs
I screamed so loud, but no one heard a thing

Said I think I am finally clean

Ten months sober, I must admit
Just because you're clean, don't mean you don't miss it
Ten months older, I won't give in
Now that I'm clean, I'm never gonna risk it

Some place under the sun

And there's a place that I've dreamed of
Where I can free my mind
I hear the sounds of the season
And lose all, sense of time


I'm moving far away
To a sunny place
Where it's just you and me
Feels like we're in a dream

The summer air by the seaside
The way it fills our lungs
The fire burns in the night sky

Dirty tissues, trust issues
Glasses on the sink, they didn't fix you
Lonely pillows in a stranger's bed
Little voices in my head
Secret keeping, stop the bleeding
Lost a little weight because I wasn't eating
All the souls that I can't listen to, to tell the truth


Loving you was young, and wild, and free
Loving you was cool, and hot, and sweet
Loving you was sunshine, safe and sound
A steady place to let down my defenses
But loving you had consequences


Hesitation, awkward conversation
Running on low expectation
Every siren that I was ignoring
I'm paying for it


Loving you was young, and wild, and free
Loving you was cool, and hot, and sweet

We were in the backseat
Drunk on something stronger than the drinks in the bar
"I rent a place on Cornelia Street"
I say casually in the car
We were a fresh page on the desk
Filling in the blanks as we go
As if the street lights pointed in an arrow head
Leading us home


And I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
That's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name
And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again


Windows flung right open, autumn air
Jacket 'round my shoulders is yours
We bless the rains on Cornelia Street
Memorize the creaks in the floor
Back when we were card sharks, playing games
I thought you were leading me on
I packed my bags, left Cornelia Street
Before you even knew I was gone
You might also like
But then you called, showed your hand
I turned around before I hit the tunnel
Sat on the roof, you and I


I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
That's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name (City screams your name)
And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again

You hold my hand on the street
Walk me back to that apartment
Years ago, we were just inside
Barefoot in the kitchen
Sacred new beginnings
That became my religion, listen


I hope I never lose you
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
Oh, never again
And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name (City screams your name)
And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again

I don't wanna lose you (Hope it never ends)
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I don't wanna lose you (Yeah)

Years ago, we were just inside
Barefoot in the kitchen

That became my religion, listen


I hope I never lose you
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
Oh, never again
And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name (City screams your name)
And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again


I don't wanna lose you (Hope it never ends)

I don't wanna lose you (Yeah)

We were in the backseat
Drunk on something stronger than the drinks in the bar
"I rent a place on Cornelia Street"
I say casually in the car
We were a fresh page on the desk
Filling in the blanks as we go
As if the street lights pointed in an arrow head
Leading us home


And I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
That's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name
And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again


Windows flung right open, autumn air
Jacket 'round my shoulders is yours
We bless the rains on Cornelia Street
Memorize the creaks in the floor
Back when we were card sharks, playing games
I thought you were leading me on
I packed my bags, left Cornelia Street
Before you even knew I was gone
You might also like
But then you called, showed your hand
I turned around before I hit the tunnel
Sat on the roof, you and I


I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
That's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name (City screams your name)
And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again

Walk me back to that apartment

And I don't think the world is sold

I live inside my own world of make-believe
Kids screaming in their cradles, profanities
I see the world through eyes covered in ink and bleach
Cross out the ones who heard my cries and watched me weep


I love everything
Fire's spreading all around my room
My world’s so bright
It's hard to breathe but that's alright
Hush

Tape my eyes open to force reality (Oh no, no)
Why can’t you just let me eat my weight in glee?
I live inside my own world of make-believe
Kids screaming in their cradles, profanities
Some days I feel skinnier than all the other days
Sometimes I can't tell if my body belongs to me

Just wanna be care free lately, yeah
Just kicking up daisies
Got one too many quarters in my pockets
Count ’em like the four-leaf clovers in my locket
Untied laces, yeah

Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below

What doesn't kill me makes me want you more

And it's ooh, woah-oh

It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh

And I cried like a baby comin' home from the bar (Oh)
Said, "I'm fine," but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)
And I scream, "For whatever it's worth
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?"
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)","['empowerment', 'energy', 'adventure']"

Hagas lo que hagas, nunca le digas a ninguna zorra que la amas
Si no lo dices en serio, no se lo digas (Probando)


Cariño, yo sigo (Sigo enamorándome)
Cariño, yo sigo (Sigo enamorándome)
Da-da, da, sigo (Sigo enamorándome)
Siempre es mucho (Vamos)


Ooh, tengo un problema, no sé si pueda cambiar
Ooh, ellos quieren rechazarme, pero es solo mi cerebro
No puedo firmar el dominó
¿Cuánto dura para siempre?

Cariño, yo sigo (Sigo enamorándome)
Cariño, yo sigo (Sigo enamorándome)
Da-da, da, sigo (Sigo enamorándome)
Siempre es mucho


Yuh, dejo еse fuego, lo pruebo, yo
Conduzco mi proyеctor en verano cuando estoy listo para derrapar
LaFerrari no es mejor, y es demasiado bonito
Me siento seguro en el Rolls, chico grande cuando conduzco
Los amo a todos por diferentes razones al mismo maldito tiempo
Miro monogamia, esta mierda no es para mí
Una opción para todos, no me mientas
Demasiados surcos, soy demasiado curioso para intentarlo
Escondiendo cosas, sintiendo vergüenza dentro de mí
Porque honestamente, (Phss) T no es perfecto
Entonces, ¿cómo es que obtuve todo de una persona?
Estoy en el altar, pero sigo buscando
Soy solo un humano y si no vale la pena
Las cosas cambian y déjenme seguir igual
Creo, ¿quién es el vecino que está dejándolo pasar?
Es algo hermoso
Perfecto por el momento, no he hecho nada malo
La vida es corta, pero la eternidad es demasiada larga
Parece mucho tiempo, estoy en mi propio tiempo
Amo a esta chica, encontré una mina de oro
Estoy pensando en una nueva casa, estoy pensando en dos niños
Hasta que me encapriche con una nueva perra
Pero cuando finalmente el cabezo gris aparezca (Uh-huh)
Al menos siento algo si no encuentro al indicado (Yuh)
Nadie puede llenarme como lo hace esta mierda de la música
Así que estaré solo con estos Grammys cuando todo esté dicho y hecho—vamos (Oh)

My love was as cruel as the cities I lived in
Everyone looked worse in the light
There are so many lines that I've crossed unforgiven
I'll tell you the truth but never goodbye


I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
I've been sleepin' so long in a twenty-year dark night
And now I see daylight, I only see daylight


Luck of the draw only draws the unlucky
And so I became the butt of the joke
I wounded the good and I trusted the wicked
Clearin' the air, I breathed in the smoke


Maybe you ran with the wolves and refused to settle down
Maybe I've stormed out of every single room in this town
Threw out our cloaks and our daggers because it's morning now
It's brighter now, now


I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
(I can never look away)
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
(Things will never be the same)
I've been sleepin' so long in a twenty-year dark night
(Now I'm wide awake)

But it's golden (Golden)
And I can still see it all (In my head)
Back and forth from New York (Sneakin' in your bed)

But it's golden
Like daylight, like daylight

It's golden like daylight
You gotta step into the daylight and let it go
Just let it go, let it go

I wanna be defined by the things that I love

Long were the nights
When my days once revolved around you
Counting my footsteps
Prayin' the floor won't fall through again
And my mother accused me of losin' my mind
But I swore I was fine
You paint me a blue sky
Then go back and turn it to rain
And I lived in your chess game
But you change the rules every day
Wonderin' which version of you
I might get on the phone tonight
Well, I stopped pickin' up
And this song is to let you know why


Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
I shoulda known


Well, maybe it's me and my blind optimism to blame
Or maybe it's you and your sick need
To give love and take it away
And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors
Who don't understand

You are an expert at "Sorry" and keepin' lines blurry
Never impressed by me acing your tests
All the girls that you run dry have tired, lifeless eyes
'Cause you burned them out
But I took your matches before fire could catch me

I been thinking of our future 'cause I'll never see those days
I don't know why this has happened, but I probably deserve it
I tried to do my best, but you know that I'm not perfect
I been praying for forgiveness, you've been praying for my health
When I leave this earth, hopin' you'll find someone else
'Cause yeah, we still young, there's so much we haven't done
Getting married, start a family, watch your husband with his son
I wish it could be me, but I won't make it out this bed
I hope I go to heaven so I see you once again
My life was kinda short, but I got so many blessings
Happy you were mine, it sucks that it's all ending

And sneak out through your kitchen at exactly 1:03
Sundays, went to church, on Mondays, watched a movie
Soon you'll be alone, sorry that you have to lose me

Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed


Yeah, I don't wanna fall asleep, I don't wanna pass away
I been thinking of our future 'cause I'll never see those days
I don't know why this has happened, but I probably deserve it
I tried to do my best, but you know that I'm not perfect
I been praying for forgiveness, you've been praying for my health
When I leave this earth, hopin' you'll find someone else
'Cause yeah, we still young, there's so much we haven't done
Getting married, start a family, watch your husband with his son
I wish it could be me, but I won't make it out this bed
I hope I go to heaven so I see you once again
My life was kinda short, but I got so many blessings
Happy you were mine, it sucks that it's all ending


Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed (Yeah, ayy)
Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed (Ayy, yeah)


I'm happy that you here with me, I'm sorry if I tear up
When me and you were younger, you would always make me cheer up
Taking goofy videos and walking through the park
You would jump into my arms every time you heard a bark
Cuddle in your sheets, sing me sound asleep
And sneak out through your kitchen at exactly 1:03
Sundays, went to church, on Mondays, watched a movie
Soon you'll be alone, sorry that you have to lose me


Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed
Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed
Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed

Saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
Flashbacks waking me up
I get drunk, but it's not enough
’Cause the morning comes and you're not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier's still flickering here
’Cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not
It's death by a thousand cuts


I dress to kill my time, I take the long way home
I ask the traffic lights if it'll be alright
They say, "I don't know"
And what once was ours is no one's now
I see you everywhere, the only thing we share
Is this small town
You said it was a great love, one for the ages
But if the story’s over, why am I still writing pages?

This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so

We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink

Dive bar on the East Side, where you at?
Phone lights up my nightstand in the black
Come here, you can meet me in the back
Dark jeans and your Nikes, look at you
Oh, damn, never seen that color blue
Just think of the fun things we could do

This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink

Dive bar on the East Side, where you at?
Phone lights up my nightstand in the black
Come here, you can meet me in the back
Dark jeans and your Nikes, look at you
Oh, damn, never seen that color blue
Just think of the fun things we could do


('Cause I like you) This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me
(Yeah, I want you) We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink


Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it chill that you're in my head?

Third floor on the West Side, me and you
Handsome, you're a mansion with a view
Do the girls back home touch you like I do?
Long night with your hands up in my hair
Echoes of your footsteps on the stairs
Stay here, honey, I don't wanna share


('Cause I like you) This ain't for the best

When the days are cold and the cards all fold
And the saints we see are all made of gold
When your dreams all fail and the ones we hail
Are the worst of all, and the blood's run stale


I wanna hide the truth, I wanna shelter you
But with the beast inside, there's nowhere we can hide
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come


When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close, it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide


At the curtain's call it's the last of all
When the lights fade out, all the sinners crawl
So they dug your grave and the masquerade
Will come calling out at the mess you've made


Don't wanna let you down, but I am hell-bound
Though this is all for you, don't wanna hide the truth
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come

(Live at the BBC) Lyrics
Have you got colour in your cheeks?
Do you ever get that fear that you can't shift
The tide that sticks around
Like somethin' in your teeth?
Are there some aces up your sleeve?
You've no idea that you're in deep?
I dreamt about you nearly
Every night this week
How many secrets can you keep?
'Cause there's this tune I found
That makes me think of you somehow
And I play it on repeat
Until I fall asleep
Spillin' drinks on my settee


Do I wanna know if this feelin' goes both ways?
It's sad to see you go, sorta hopin' that you'd stay
Darlin', we both know that the nights are mainly made
For sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day


Crawlin' back to you
Ever thought of callin' when you've had a few?
'Causе I always do

Don't blame me, love made me crazy

Shaking, pacin', I just need you

Yeah
Hey, what are you hiding? (Watch)
What you doin' when you're gone? (Hey, hey)
Nothing wrong being private (watch)
Make sure it ain't wrong (yeah)
Your life double-sided (watch)
Two-faced like coins
What side do I get? (Watch)
What side are you on?
So what have you done? (Brrah)
Some of your dirt has come to light (yeah)
Why were you speedin' up that hill until the brakes come off? (Hey, hey)
And someone saw you in a fight
Am I right?
It doesn't matter to you if you get heads or tails
You just don't like to flip all the time
But if you spin it then you get to see both sides
Oh, the thrill of the double life
Lie detector time (watch)
Do you feel bad when you lie? (Watch)
The look on your face says the best life (watch)
And then come home like it's fine
Am I right? (Watch)
So what have you done?
Some of your dirt has come to light
Why were you speedin' up that hill until the brakes come off? (Hey)
And someone saw you in a fight
Am I right? (Ah)
It doesn't matter to you if you get heads or tails
You just don't like to flip all the time
But if you spin it then you get to see both sides
Oh, the thrill of the double life (brrah)
Who will you be tonight?
That's the question (brrah)
Who will Gru be tonight?
That's the question (yeah)
I know you heard the rumors (hey)
You must get over to it right away (oh)
If anyone can do it, you gotta get there soon, it's not okay (hey)
You got cars to drive, plenty jets to fly (baow, baow)
When will you arrive? You're running out of time
Don't you see that everything is on the line?
So I'm sorry but you have to choose a side
You'll never know when it's your time to go (side, hey)
And where you end up in life, that's code (side)
You can't ignore, you're spinning your life (baow, baow)
Your watch is broken 'cause you spent all your time (side)
It's now or never, on this, everything rides (side)
Before the spinning stops, you must pick a side (yeah, yeah, brrah)
Who will you be tonight?
That's the question (yeah, yeah)

Did you really beam me up
In a cloud of sparkling dust
Just to do experiments on?
Tell me I was the chosen one
Showed me that this world is bigger than us
Then sent me back where I came from


For a moment, I knew cosmic love


Now I'm down bad, cryin' at the gym
Everything comes out teenage petulance
"Fuck it if I can't have him"
"I might just die, it would make no difference"
Down bad, wakin' up in blood
Starin' at the sky, come back and pick me up
Fuck it if I can't have us
I might just not get up, I might stay


Down bad
Fuck it if I can't have him
Down bad
Fuck it if I can't have him

Did you take all my old clothes
Just to leave me here, naked and alone
In a field in my same old town
That somehow seems so hollow now?
They'll say I'm nuts if I talk about
The existence of you


For a moment, I was heavenstruck


Now I'm down bad, cryin' at the gym (Cryin' at the gym)
Everything comes out teenage petulance
"Fuck it if I can't have him" (Fuck it if I can't have him)
"I might just die, it would make no difference"
Down bad, wakin' up in blood (Wakin' up in blood)
Starin' at the sky, come back and pick me up
Fuck it if I can't have us
I might just not get up, I might stay


Down bad (Like I lost my twin)
Fuck it if I can't have him (Down bad)
Down bad (Wavin' at the ship)
Fuck it if I can't have him

I loved your hostile takeovers
Encounters closer and closer
All your indecent exposures
How dare you say that it's—
I'll build you a fort on some planet
Where they can all understand it
How dare you think it's romantic
Leaving me safe and stranded
'Cause fuck it, I was in love
So fuck you if I can't have us
'Cause fuck it, I was in love

I got my driver's license last week
Just like we always talked about
'Cause you were so excited for me
To finally drive up to your house
But today, I drove through the suburbs
Crying 'cause you weren't around


And you're probably with that blonde girl
Who always made me doubt
She's so much older than me
She's everything I'm insecure about
Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs
'Cause how could I ever love someone else?


And I know we weren't perfect, but I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street


And all my friends are tired
Of hearing how much I miss you, but
I kinda feel sorry for them
'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do
Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs
And pictured I was driving home to you

Can't drive past the places we used to go to
'Cause I still fuckin' love you, babe (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)

5th of November
When I walked you home
That's when I nearly said it
But then said, "Forget it" and froze
Do you remember?
You probably don't
'Cause the sparks in the sky
Took a hold of your eyes while we spoke


Yesterday, drank way too much
And stayed up too late
Started to write what I wanna say
Deleted the message
But I still remember it said


I wish I was who you drunk texted at midnight
Wish I was the reason you stay up till 3
And you can't fall asleep
Waiting for me to reply
I wish I was more than just someone you walk by
Wish I wasn't scared to be honest and open
Instead of just hoping
You'd feel what I'm feeling inside

April the 7th
And nothing has changed
It's hard to get by
When you're still on my mind everyday
Sometimes I question
If you feel the same
Do we make stupid jokes?
Trying to hide that we're both too afraid to say


I wish I was who you drunk texted at midnight
Wish I was the reason you stay up till 3
And you can't fall asleep
Waiting for me to reply
I wish I was more than just someone you walk by
Wish I wasn't scared to be honest and open
Instead of just hoping
You'd feel what I'm feeling inside


Oh, and here we go again
Destroy myself to keep a friend
Hiding away 'cause I was afraid you'd say no
I wonder if I cross your mind
Half as much as you do mine
If I tell you the truth
What will I lose? I don't know

I wish I had sent you that drunk text at midnight
I was just scared it would ruin our friendship
But I really meant it
I wonder how you would reply1Embed

There I was again tonight
Forcing laughter, faking smiles
Same old tired, lonely place
Walls of insincerity
Shifting eyes and vacancy
Vanished when I saw your face
All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you


Your eyes whispered, "Have we met?"
Across the room, your silhouette
Starts to make its way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks
Like passing notes in secrecy
And it was enchanting to meet you
All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you


This night is sparklin', don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushin' all the way home
I'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you


The lingering question kept me up
2AM, who do you love?
I wonder 'til I'm wide awake
And now, I'm pacing back and forth
Wishing you were at my door
I'd open up and you would say
"Hey, it was enchanting to meet you"
All I know is I was enchanted to meet you

I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you


This is me praying that
This was the very first page
Not where the storyline ends
My thoughts will echo your name
Until I see you again
These are the words I held back
As I was leaving too soon
I was enchanted to meet you
Please, don't be in love with someone else
Please, don't have somebody waiting on you
Please, don't be in love with someone else (Ooh)
Please, don't have somebody waiting on you (Ooh, oh)


This night is sparklin', don't you let it go

You said you cared, and you missed me too
And I'm well aware I write too many songs about you
And the coffee's out at the Beachwood Cafe

Man, I can understand how it might be
Kinda hard to love a girl like me
I don't blame you much for wanting to be free
I just wanted you to know
Woo, woo
Swizz told me let the beat rock (Oh)

For all my Southside niggas that know me best
I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex
Why? I made that bitch famous (Goddamn)

For all the girls that got dick from Kanye West
If you see 'em in the streets, give 'em Kanye's best
Why? They mad they ain't famous (Goddamn)
They mad they still nameless (Talk that talk, man)
Her man in the store tryna try his best
But he just can't seem to get Kanye fresh
But we still hood famous (Goddamn)
Yeah, we still hood famous


I just wanted you to know
I've loved you better than your own kin did

Starting from zero, got nothing to lose
Maybe we'll make something

And I got a plan to get us out of here
I've been working at a convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
We won't have to drive too far
Just across the border and into the city

I say, his body's too young to look like his

I said, somebody's got to take care of him
So I quit school and that's what I did

And we go cruising to entertain ourselves

Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs

We're driving down the road
I wonder if you know
I'm trying so hard not to get caught up now
But you're just so cool
Run your hands through your hair
Absent-mindedly makin' me want you


And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me headfirst, fearless
And I don't know why, but with you, I'd dance
In a storm, in my best dress, fеarless

In this passenger seat, you put your eyes on me

Mamy nasze sekrety ukryte w naszych kościach (Kościach)
Światło gwiazd, które krwawi, gdy włączają się wszystkie światła


To piękny cud
Jak mnie podnosisz, gdy czuję się przygnębiony
Piękny wieczny blask
Teraz błyszczymy jak morze złota, tak


Dziś wieczorem jesteśmy w ogniu
Jak milion diamentów na niebie (Ooh, ooh)
I zgubiliśmy się we wszystkich światłach
Tutaj razem
Dziś wieczorem jesteśmy w ogniu


Jesteśmy w ogniu, och, och-och
Jesteśmy w ogniu, och, och-och (Och-och)


Żyję wspomnieniami, prowadząc mnie przez ciemność, mm-mm
Jesteś nutą mojej melodii, leczącą wszystkie moje blizny


To piękny cud
Jak mnie podnosisz, gdy czuję się przygnębiony
Piękny wieczny blask
Teraz błyszczymy jak morze złota, tak


Dziś wiеczorem jesteśmy w ogniu
Jak milion diamеntów na niebie (Ooh, ooh)
I zgubiliśmy się we wszystkich światłach
Tutaj razem
Dziś wieczorem jesteśmy w ogniu


Jesteśmy w ogniu, ohh, oh-oh (Oh-ooh)
Teraz płoniemy, ohh, oh-oh (Ooh)
I zgubiliśmy się we wszystkich światłach
Tutaj razem
Dziś wieczorem jesteśmy w ogniu

When you try your best, but you don't succeed
When you get what you want, but not what you need
When you feel so tired, but you can't sleep
Stuck in reverse


And the tears come streamin' down your face
When you lose somethin' you can't replace
When you love someone, but it goes to waste
Could it be worse?


Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you


And high up above or down below
When you're too in love to let it go
But if you never try, you'll never know
Just what you're worth

(feat. Florence + the Machine) (Bản dịch tiếng Việt) LyricsYou can beat the heat
Bạn sẽ thoát khỏi sự gay gắt

If you beat the charges, too
Nếu bác bỏ được những cáo buộc

They said I was a cheat
Họ bảo em là kẻ lừa dối

I guess it must be true
Chắc hình như là đúng thế rồi

And my friends all smell like weed or little babies
Và đám bạn em đều có mùi như cần sa hay mấy bé sơ sinh

And this city reeks of driving myself crazy
Và cái thành phố nặng mùi đang khiến em phát rồ

Little did you know
Người liệu có biết rằng

Your home's really only a town
Thành phố quê người chỉ là một chốn

You're just a guest in
Nơi người là khách
You might also likeSo you work your life away
Nên người làm việc cật lực

Just to pay for a timeshare
Chỉ để thuê một căn timeshare

Down in Destin
Ở tận Destin

Florida!!!
Florida!!!

Is one hell of a drug
Là một thứ ma dược

Florida!!!
Florida!!!

Can I use you up?
Em dùng hết được không?

The hurricane with my name when it came
Khi cơn bão mang tên em đổ bộ

I got drunk and I dare it to wash me away
Em say mèm, và thách thức nó cuốn em đi xa
Barricaded in the bathroom with a bottle of wine
Che chắn trong nhà tắm với một chai rượu đắng

Well me and my ghosts, we had a hell of a time
Ôi, em với những bóng ma, tụi em đã có khoảng thời gian thật tuyệt

Yes I'm haunted, but I'm feeling just fine
Ừ, em bị ám đấy, nhưng em thấy vẫn ổn mà

All my girls got their lace and their crimes
Đám bạn em đều diện đồ ren che đi những tội ác

And your cheating husband disappeared, well
Và ông chồng ngoại tình của người đã biến mất

No one asks any questions here
Well, chẳng có ai thắc mắc gì ở chốn này

So I did my best to lay to rest
Nên em cứ thoải mái nghỉ ngơi

All of the bodies that have ever been on my body
Tất thảy những thân xác đã từng qua tay em

And in my mind, they sink into the swamp
Trong tâm trí em, họ đã chìm hết xuống đầm lầy
Is that a bad thing to say in a song?
Đấy có phải một điều tệ hại để kể trong một bài hát không ta?

Little did you know your home's
Người liệu có biết rằng quê nhà của người

Really only the town you'll get arrested
Thật sự sẽ là nơi người bị bắt giữ

So you pack your life away
Nên người làm việc cật lực

Just to wait out the shitstorm
Chỉ để chờ cho cơn bão dư luận tan đi

Em sẽ chôn vùi chúng ở Florida

Tell me I'm despicable
Nói rằng em là kẻ đáng khinh

Say it's unforgivable

Once upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
And we caught onto somethin'
I hold onto the night
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
Were you just kiddin'?
'Cause it seems to me
This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
Baby, what happened? Please, tell me
'Cause, one second, it was perfect
Now you're halfway out the door


And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothin' at all
And you flashback to when he said, "Forever and always," oh
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom, everythin' is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said, "Forever and always"


Was I out of line?
Did I say somethin' way too honest, made you run and hide
Like a scared little boy?
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute, now I'm not so sure
So here's to everything coming down to nothin'
Here's to silence that cuts me to the core
Where is this going?

Hoping for the best but expecting the worst
Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?


Let us die young or let us live forever
We don't have the power but we never say never
Sitting in a sandpit, life is a short trip
The music's for the sad men


Can you imagine when this race is won
Turn our golden faces into the sun
Praising our leaders, we're getting in tune
The music's played by the, the mad man

Em đáng ra phải bị bắt đi rồi
Nhưng người ta đã quên đến đón em
Em là một con sâu rượu đang sống ổn thoả
Cho đến khi chẳng còn ai để ý đến gu thẩm mỹ mới của em nữa
Tất cả để nói rằng
Em mong anh vẫn ổn
Nhưng anh chính là lý do
Và chẳng ai trách gì đâu
Nhưng còn sự phản bội lặng thầm của anh thì sao?


Và trong suốt 2 tuần ấy, mình bên nhau muôn đời
Đôi lần chạm mặt anh, hỏi vu vơ thời tiết
Giờ anh sau sân vườn, hóa thành hàng xóm tốt
Vợ anh đang tưới hoa, em muốn giết chết ả


Những sớm mai của em là những thứ Hai mắc kẹt trong một tháng 2 bất tận
Em đã uống thứ thuốc bước tiếp diệu kỳ, nhưng tác dụng chỉ là tạm thời thôi
Và em yêu anh, thứ tình yêu đang phá hủy đời em
Em yêu anh, thứ tình yêu đang phá hủy đời em

Now, pretty baby, I'm runnin' back home to you
Fresh out the slammer, I know who my first call will be to
(Fresh out the slammer, oh)


Another summer takin' cover, rolling thunder
He don't understand me
Splintered back in winter, silent dinners, bitter
He was with her in dreams


Gray and blue and fights and tunnels
Handcuffed to the spell I was under
For just one hour of sunshine
Years of labor, locks, and ceilings
In the shade of how he was feeling
But it's gonna be alright, I did my time


Now, pretty baby, I'm runnin' back home to you
Frеsh out the slammer, I know who my first call will be to

Toss the ashes off the ledge
As I said in my letters, now that I know better
I will never lose my baby again

For just one glimpse of his smile

Swirled you into all of my poems
Now we're at the starting line, I did my time


Now, pretty baby, I'm runnin'


To the house where you still wait up and that porch light gleams (Gleams)
To the one who says I'm the girl of his American dreams
And no matter what I've done, it wouldn't matter anyway
Ain't no way I'm gonna screw up now that I know what's at stake here
At the park where we used to sit on children's swings

No irony
No "Who cares?," no vacant stare

Innocence died screaming, honey, ask me, I should know
I slithered here from Eden just to sit outside your door

I’ll dance Bhangra on the beat, you too dance the vulture dance, come, let’s have such fun here, that everyone goes crazy having fun..

Mann kahe ki main le aaun chaand aur taare saare in haathon par main chaand rakhoon is maang mein bhar doon taare

The heart says I’ll go and get moon and all the stars, I’ll keep moon there in these hands, and fill the stars in your hair parting.

Hello! Hello! Tu floor pe kab hai aayi ye lo, ye lo, baDi solid masti chaayi
Hello! Hello! Too much hai tumne lagaayi ye lo, ye lo, control karo mere bhai

Hello, Hello, when did you come to the floor, take this, take this, what a solid fun is going on here.. hello, hello, you have had (drunk) too much, take this, take this, control my brother..

Dhak-dhak dhak-dhak dhadke ye dil chhan chhan bole amritsari choodiyaan raat badi hai mastaani koi dilbar jaani kar le gallan goodiyaan

The heart beats, thump-thump, and Amritsar’s bangles jingle, the night is such a fun, some beloved should talk sweetly (to me)..

Chhanaa chhanaka tere tana dutanaka tere chhanaa chhanaka tere tana dutanaka tera..

Doesn’t have a meaning, it’s more like singing some beats.

Main kabootar faseya ki hor koi fase hi na haay fase hi na

I, a pigeon, am trapped, but no other gets trapped..

Ye baat na maine jaani kyun itni khush hai diwaani tu mujhko aisi kahaani samjha de, samjha de..
I have known this thing why the crazy one is so happy, you tell me such a story, such a story..

Ye baat hai sabne chaahi mile janmon ka humraahi yahaan huaa hai kuch aisa hi samjhe na samjhe na o ho..

Every one has wanted this thing, that we get a partner for all our lives (even if there are more than one lives) here something like that has happened, you have got it, right?

Ab main jaana keh rahi ho kya fasaana ho ho. Pyaar karne se bhi mushqil hai nibhaana ho ho

Now I have understood what story you have been telling, it is tougher to maintain love on than falling in love..

Hello! Hello! Don't mind mera ye kehna ye lo, ye lo, zara mere touch mein rehna

Hello, hello, don’t mind when I say this, take this, take this, be in touch..

Dhak-dhak dhak-dhak dhadke ye dil chhan chhan bole amritsari choodiyan raat badi hai mastaani koi dilbar jaani kar le gallan goodiyan raat badi hai mastaanee..

Low on self-esteem, so you run on gasoline"

When our children ask us how did we meet, I'm tellin' them, "Gen Z love"
"FYP love, IG love"


My crisis ain't from cost of living
I think 'bout death like, "God forbid it"
American Express got no limit
Career consists of lots of women
How can I convince you I'm not the villain?
Shit's dramatic like opera singin'
Down on one knee, I got a proposition
In the past I was not consistent
Out of these girls, you're top division
Can't downgrade and lower my standard
When I first saw you on the 'Gram, bae, I was in awe and showin' the mandem
Askin' advice, "How can I slide in there?"
Usin' words not my usual language
I clocked that you just came out of a breakup
Been on your social media ranting
Slid up and replied to your story, you ain't responded, I wanna unsend it
Got me stalkin' your Facebook page and preeing your friends list
Saw that you followed a fellow acquaintance
You ain't even mine, yet I'm feelin' envious

But you don't fuck with them, me neither
When I'm with you, I get baby fever
I met your mum on the FYP
We're young and our love's Gen Z
Mum said that it ain't gon' last
I'm tellin' her, "We gon' see"
They say our relationship is childish
You're my baby, so I agree
Started with an IG like
Now you're down to ride, just like a G


If it weren't for the algorithm, I wouldn't have found my woman
We're messin' around and act like kids, give me a nostalgic feelin'
Took you on all of them trips, now you got my accountant trippin'
Sent you a thousand roses, not like you're local, a thousand miles I've driven
You ain't even gave me the ick yet, I ain't even seen red flags yet
Get mad and you call me a dickhead, got me addicted, feel like a crackhead
Passenger seat just givin' me side-eye, it's giving main-character syndrome
You ain't gotta connect to the Wi-Fi, let's just talk and put down the iPhone
She liked my post, I liked her post
Love at first sight, love at first scroll
I ain't perfect, I'm tryna learn though
I hope it's worth it when we turn old
Still recoverin', I'm not okay
So I'm paranoid that she won't stay
I might catch a whine, this ain't Soul Train

You're my baby, so I agree
Started with an IG like
Now you're down to ride, just like a G


If it weren't for the algorithm, I wouldn't have found my woman
We're messin' around and act like kids, give me a nostalgic feelin'
Took you on all of them trips, now you got my accountant trippin'
Sent you a thousand roses, not like you're local, a thousand miles I've driven
You ain't even gave me the ick yet, I ain't even seen red flags yet
Get mad and you call me a dickhead, got me addicted, feel like a crackhead
Passenger seat just givin' me side-eye, it's giving main-character syndrome
You ain't gotta connect to the Wi-Fi, let's just talk and put down the iPhone
She liked my post, I liked her post
Love at first sight, love at first scroll
I ain't perfect, I'm tryna learn though
I hope it's worth it when we turn old
Still recoverin', I'm not okay
So I'm paranoid that she won't stay
I might catch a whine, this ain't Soul Train
I'm afraid this ain't like the old days


When our children ask us how did we meet
I'm tellin' them, "Gen Z love, FYP love, IG love"
Saw her on the Explore Page, like, I need to explore deeper
Suggested accounts said that we got mutuals
But you don't fuck with them, me neither
When I'm with you, I get baby fever
I met your mum on the FYP
We're young and our love's Gen Z
Mum said that it ain't gon' last
I'm tellin' her, "We gon' see"
They say our relationship is childish
You're my baby, so I agree

Now you're down to ride, just like a G","['romance', 'empowerment', 'adventure']"

Half-past twelve
And I'm watchin' the late show in my flat, all alone
How I hate to spend the evening on my own
Autumn winds
Blowin' outside the window as I look around the room
And it makes me so depressed to see the gloom


There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer


Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away?
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day


Movie stars
Find the end of the rainbow with a fortune to win
It's so different from the world I'm livin' in
Tired of TV
I open the window and I gaze into the night
But there's nothing there to see, no one in sight

Я могу выпить бутылку. Алкоголь - и я, словно Гадзилла
Попаду в колоду, будто крупье в казино
Весь мой сквад тут на тусе ходит туда-сюда
Помесь зомби апокалипсиса и Бобби Хинана "Мозга" я
Ведь со мной вновь сражается также моя же мания
Shady вернулся, взрывать пора
Говоришь, от меня клонит в сон тебя?
Вот тогда тебе бессоница
У тебя дефицит внимания, успокойся и слушай сейчас меня
Чел, выпей коньяка
Убью из АК с кулака, для меня это не больше, чем игра
Отсякай, видишь меня отступай, тут орёт тревога
Этот бит сумасшедший, смешной (хах), как будто Ray J
Угараю по дороге до банка, брызжа слюной, вам не успокоить
Во мне...


Монстра
Встанешь на пути моём, скормлю тебя монстру
Весь день такой как ты, но ночью превращаюсь в монстра
При свете луны, что сияет так ясно
Я становлюсь злодеем. Это мой блокбастер
Гадзилла, всё в огне, я монстр
В крови ковёр луи ви, в крови весь танцпол
Всё горит, Гадзилла, всё в огне, я монстр
В крови ковёр луи ви, в крови весь танцпол

Я лишь продукт Слика Рика из Оникса, своим треком их ужасну
Разозлю, хоть их сотни всех. Невозможно даже перечесть
И вдобавок ко всему этому я в психушке в руках верчу
Магический шар
В попытках узнать, каково будет завтра:
После рисперидона будет ли шанс?
Мой кулак, будто карандаш, чертит круги на стене
Черти кричат все во мне
Эта песня даст веру тебе
Ты направил свой ствол на парня с базукой в руке
Я из Лох-Несса вылез, прямо из мифов
Как только грохну свой полтиник водки
Лишь откручу крышку, ты увидишь...

Если тебе так же пох, руки вверх!
Ведь я уже собрался в отдых. Бэд Трип подъехал
Нахожусь на месте, как мой индекс, теперь всё, что ты увидишь
Лишь мой средний палец, подниму выше!
Как у меня могут быть только фаны?
Горю, как у лжеца память
Я не думал вас даже оставить без восхищений текстами
И эти дамы прекрасны, меня заводят опасно
И я их очаровал всех, они теряют сознание
И всё снова крутится, крутится, словно цепь бензопилы
Я машу волшебной палочкой, как битой, исполню мечты
Сука, я сделал эти бабки слишком просто как Кид Инк
Называй меня Дидди
Создаю группы, что мне дают прибыль
Слышь, я в игре, скуп на делёж, что принадлежит мне
Я не дам слова тебе, не притворюсь даже, мэн
Но я сказал суке, что женюсь на ней, если она после будет в земле
Я как Ричард Рамирес ебашу людей
Не стою на месте, как Кристиан Ривера
Все мои тексты вихляют подобно мне
Как при параличе, это страшно, я зову что Гарри Карей
Ведь каждый Том. Дик и Гарри всегда имеют грёбанный словарь при себе
Это смешно и нелепо. Ведь они подобно мне
Трясутся над ним, божатся, клянутся над ним
Пришло время пересечься с глазу на глаз с этой острой проблемой
Пора быстрее, составить некролог о каждом. Теперь и мне похер, поверь
Пора палить, зарядил ствол, полон чернил он
Злая половина меня сместит вновь, и людей привлекают мои тексты всё ещё
Он смотрят на них, как на гангстеров
Будто я буду щас стрелять всех
Каждый трей, как джингл, в магазин вложил их
Теперь пришло время их всех положить!
Наполняю ядом и рядом перебиваю
Другими словами, я из них соки выжимаю
Не хотел убивать всех, но я в приступе ярости
Ты не в силах сбежать теперь, я не чувствую жалости
Они меня ненавидят, и я не знаю усталости, и вот я настигаю их
И перемалываю в ярости
Я чувствую, будто бы стал на голову тронутым, во мне демон
И я знаю, он по крови их голоден
Либо ты убиваешь, либо убит будешь скоро ты, я подорву тебя
И раскидаю в разные стороны
Моя каждая часть сделана из зла и насилия
Если ты меня увидишь, то поверь, ты бессилен
Убегай или молись, но никак не беси меня, или в ту же минуту
Я разорву на куски тебя
Ты не станешь как я даже на пару процентов
Я собираюсь покончить с тобой, ты знаешь об этом
Меня подобные тебе вызывают на бэттл, но я не победим
Вовсе не убиваем и неподелен
Переделываю строки и не знаю предела я
У меня есть много денег, они раскиданы в трейлере
Я не боюсь потянутся за моим...

Чел стой
Смотри что в планах!

Well, good for you, I guess you're gettin' everything you want (Ah)
You bought a new car and your career's really takin' off (Ah)
It's like we never even happened
Baby, what the fuck is up with that? (Ah)
And good for you, it's like you never even met me
Remember when you swore to God I was the only
Person who ever got you? Well, screw that, and screw you
You will never have to hurt the way you know that I do


Well, good for you
You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
You're doin' great out there without me, baby
God, I wish that I could do that
I've lost my mind, I've spent the night
Cryin' on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you


(Ah-ah-ah-ah)
(Ah-ah-ah-ah)


Maybe I'm too emotional
But your apathy's like a wound in salt
Maybe I'm too emotional
Or maybe you never cared at all
Maybe I'm too emotional
Your apathy is like a wound in salt
Maybe I'm too emotional
Or maybe you never cared at all


Well, good for you
You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
You're doin' great out there without me, baby
Like a damn sociopath
I've lost my mind, I've spent the night
Cryin' on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you


Well, good for you, I guess you moved on really easily","['empowerment', 'self-love', 'calm']"

Young Thug) - Goodbyes (Polskie Tłumaczenie) Lyrics
Ja i Kurt czujemy to samo, zbyt duża przyjemność jest bólem
Moja dziewczyna przyprawia mnie o złość, wszystko co robię, to się skarżę
Ona potrzebuje czegoś, by się zmieniła, potrzebuję sobie u-ulżyć
Więc wieczorem jebię to wszystko
I nie mów mi, żebym się zamknął
Kiedy wiesz, że gadasz za dużo
Ale nie masz po chuja nic do powiedzenia


Nie chcę mieć Cię w mojej głowie
Nie chcę mieć wieczorem Cię w mojej sypialni (Sypialni)
Nie ma sposobu, abym Cię ocalił (Cię ocalił)
Bo też chcę być ocalony
Nie jestem dobry w pożegnaniach


Obaj zachowujemy się szaleńczo, ale jesteśmy zbyt uparci, aby się zmienić
Teraz piję ponownie, osiemdziesiąt promili w mych żyłach
I moje czubki palców są zaplamione, patrzę ponad kra-a-wędź
Nie pieprz się ze mną dziś wieczorem
Powiedziałaś, że potrzebujesz tego serca, więc je masz (Je masz)
Okazało się, że to nie było to, którego chciałaś (Chciałaś)
Nie potrafiliśmy odpuścić i to straciliśmy
Teraz jestem umarlakiem

Nie jestem dobry w pożegnaniach


Nie chcę mieć Cię w moim życiu
Chcę, abyś wieczorem tu wróciła
Chcę Ciebie pociąć, bez noża
Chcę cię pokroić i nakrajać
Moja kłótnia jest dzierżawcza, przetłumaczę Ci dokładnie
Możesz nie wyłączać telewizora? Oglądam walkę
Zalałem garaż, mam niebieskie diamenty, nie chodzi tu o rekina
Jesteś lalką Barbie w prawdziwym życiu, to Nicki Minaj
Nie potrzebujesz klucza, aby jeździć, twój samochód się ładuje
Chcę po prostu zobaczyć stronę, tą niechronioną (Tak)
I nie chcę, żebyś nigdy nie wychodziła na zewnątrz (Zewnątrz)
Obiecuję, jeżeli oni zagrają, moje ziomki wciąż prowadzą (Prowadzą)
Pieprzę ją, a autobus cały czas jedzie (Jedzie)

It's fine, it's cool
You can say that we are nothing, but you know the truth

With her arms out like an angel through the car sunroof


I don't wanna call it off
But you don't wanna call it love
You only wanna be the one that I call "baby"


You can kiss a hundred boys in bars
Shoot another shot, try to stop the feeling
You can say it's just the way you are
Make a new excuse, 'nother stupid reason

And I cry, it's not fair

Gorgeous


You should take it as a compliment
That I got drunk and made fun of the way you talk
You should think about the consequence
Of your magnetic field bein' a little too strong
And I got a boyfriend, he's older than us
He's in the club doin' I don't know what
You're so cool, it makes me hate you so much (I hate you so much)


Whisky on ice, Sunset and Vine
You've ruined my life by not bein' mine


You're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face
'Cause look at your face (Gorgeous)

At you for makin' me feel this way
But what can I say? You're gorgeous


You should take it as a compliment
That I'm talkin' to everyone here but you (But you, but you)
And you should think about the consequence
Of you touchin' my hand in a darkened room (Dark room, dark room)
If you've got a girlfriend, I'm jealous of her
But if you're single, that's honestly worse
'Cause you're so gorgeous it actually hurts (Honey, it hurts)

Lyrics
Drownin' in the Blue Nile
He sent me "Downtown Lights"
I hadn't heard it in a while
My boredom's bone-deep
This cage was once just fine
Am I allowed to cry?
I dream of crackin' locks
Throwin' my life to the wolves or the ocean rocks
Crashin' into him tonight, he's a paradox
I'm seeing visions
Am I bad or mad or wise?


What if he's written "mine" on my upper thigh only in my mind?
One slip and fallin' back into the hedge maze
Oh, what a way to die
I keep recalling things we never did
Messy top-lip kiss, how I long for our trysts
Without ever touchin' his skin
How can I be guilty as sin?


I keep these longings lockеd
In lowercase, inside a vault
Somеone told me, "There's no such thing as bad thoughts
Only your actions talk"
These fatal fantasies
Giving way to labored breath, takin' all of me
We've already done it in my head
If it's make-believe
Why does it feel like a vow we'll both uphold somehow?

Without ever touchin' his skin

What if I roll the stone away?
They're gonna crucify me anyway
What if the way you hold me is actually what's holy?
If long-suffering propriety is what they want from me
They don't know how you've haunted me so stunningly
I choose you and me religiously

You're a world away
Somewhere in the crowd
In a foreign place
Are you happy now?
There's nothing left to say
So I shut my mouth
So won't you tell me, babe
Are you happy now?


You're the only one who can up and run
Leave me just as empty as the day you came
And you hold all the cards, all the broken hearts
Strung over your shoulder till it's all in vain


And only you know the strength of your teeth
The wash in the weight of your pockets, so deep

Distant flickerings, greener scenery
This weather's bringing it all back again
Great adventures, faces in condensation
I'm going outside to take it all in


You say too late to start
Got your heart in a headlock
I don't believe any of it
You say too late to start
With your heart in a headlock
You know you're better than this


Wear a different pair, do something out of step
Throw a stranger an unexpected smile
With big intention, still posted at your station
Always on about the day it should have flied


You say too late to start
Got your heart in a headlock
I don't believe any of it
You say too late to start
With your heart in a headlock
You know you're better than this

But you like her better, wish I were Heather

Usually, I put somethin' on TV
So we never think about you and me

In Hollywood, layin' on the screen
You just need a better life than this
You need somethin' I can never give

Hello, it's me
I was wondering if, after all these years, you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya
But I ain't done much healin'
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet


There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least, I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore


Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town
Where nothing ever happened?
You might also like
It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time

But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside (Outside)

A hundred days have made me older
Since the last time that I saw your pretty face
A thousand lies have made me colder
And I don't think I can look at this the same
But all the miles that separate
Disappear now when I'm dreaming of your face


I'm here without you, baby
But you're still on my lonely mind
I think about you, baby
And I dream about you all the time
I'm here without you, baby
But you're still with me in my dreams
And tonight, it's only you and me, yeah


The miles just keep rolling
As the people leave their way to say hello
I've heard this life is overrated
But I hope that it gets better as we go
Oh yeah, yeah


I'm here without you, baby
But you're still on my lonely mind
I think about you, baby
And I dream about you all the time
I'm here without you, baby
But you're still with me in my dreams
And tonight, girl, it's only you and me, yeah

Accusing, denying
I can't imagine a world with you gone
The joy and the chaos, the demons we're made of
I'd be so lost if you left me alone
You locked yourself in the bathroom
Lying on the floor when I break through
I pull you in to feel your heartbeat
Can you hear me screaming, "Please don't leave me!"?


Hold on, I still want you
Come back, I still need you
Let me take your hand, I'll make it right
I swear to love you all my life
Hold on, I still need you


Long endless highway, you're silent beside me
Driving a nightmare I can't escape from
Helplessly praying, the light isn't fading
Hiding the shock and the chill in my bones
They took you away on a table
I pace back and forth as you lay still
They pull you in to feel your heartbeat

I could be the one, or your new addiction
It's all in my head, but I want non-fiction
I don't want the world, but I'll take this city
Who can blame a girl? Call me hot, not pretty


Baby, do you like this beat?
I made it so you'd dance with me
It's like a hundred ninety-nine degrees
When you're doing it with me, doing it with me

Lyrics
(Uh-oh, uh-oh)


We hereby conduct this post-mortem
He was a hot house flower to my outdoorsman
Our maladies were such we could not cure them
And so a touch that was my birthright became foreign

Come one, come all, it's happenin' again
The empathetic hunger descends
We'll tell no one except all of our friends
We must know
How did it end?
(Uh-oh, uh-oh)


We were blind to unforeseen circumstances
We learned thе right steps to different dancеs
And fell victim to interlopers' glances
Lost the game of chance, what are the chances?
Soon, they'll go home to their husbands
Smug 'cause they know they can trust him
Then feverishly calling their cousins
You might also like
"Guess who we ran into at the shops?
Walking in circles like she was lost
Didn't you hear? They called it all off"
One gasp and then
"How did it end?"


Say it once again with feeling
How the death rattle breathing
Silenced as the soul was leaving
The deflation of our dreaming
Leaving me bereft and reeling
My beloved ghost and me
Sitting in a tree
D-Y-I-N-G


It's happenin' again
How did it end?
I can't pretend like I understand
How did it end?


Come one, come all, it's happenin' again
The empathetic hunger descends
We'll tell no one except all of our friends
But I still don't know
How did it end5Embed

रहना है बस यहाँ, अब दूर तुझ से जाना नहीं


जो तू मेरा हमदर्द है, जो तू मेरा हमदर्द है
सुहाना हर दर्द है, जो तू मेरा हमदर्द है


तेरी मुस्कुराहटें हैं ताक़त मेरी
मुझ को इन्हीं से उम्मीद मिली
चाहे करे कोई सितम ये जहाँ
इनमें ही है सदा हिफ़ाज़त मेरी
ज़िंदगानी बड़ी ख़ूबसूरत हुई
जन्नत अब और क्या होगी कहीं


जो तू मेरा हमदर्द है, जो तू मेरा हमदर्द है
सुहाना हर दर्द है, जो तू मेरा हमदर्द है


तेरी धड़कनों से है ज़िंदगी मेरी
ख़्वाहिशें तेरी अब दुआएँ मेरी
कितना अनोखा बंधन है ये
तेरी-मेरी जान जो एक हुई
लौटूँगा यहाँ तेरे पास मैं, हाँ
वादा है मेरा, मर भी जाऊँ कहीं


जो तू मेरा हमदर्द है, जो तू मेरा हमदर्द है
सुहाना हर दर्द है, जो तू मेरा हमदर्द है

The smoke cloud billows out his mouth
Like a freight train through a small town
The jokes that he told across the bar

On a six-lane Texas highway
His hand so calloused from his pistol
Softly traces hearts on my face

I'll show you Heaven if you'll be an angel, all night
Trust me, I can handle me a dangerous man
No, really, I can


They shook their heads sayin', "God, help her"
When I told 'em he's my man (I told 'em he's my man)
But your good Lord didn't need to lift a finger
I can fix him, no, really, I can (No, really, I can)
Woah, maybe I can't","['empowerment', 'adventure', 'energy']"

I was distracted and in traffic
I didn't feel it when the earthquake happened
But it really got me thinkin', were you out drinkin'?
Were you in the living room, chillin', watchin' television?
It's been a year now, think I've figured out how
How to let you go and let communication die out


I know, you know, we know you weren't
Down for forever and it's fine
I know, you know, we know we weren't
Meant for each other and it's fine


But if the world was ending, you'd come over, right?
You'd come over and you'd stay the night
Would you love me for the hell of it?
All our fears would be irrelevant
If the world was ending, you'd come over, right?
The sky'd be falling and I'd hold you tight
And there wouldn't be a reason why
We would even have to say goodbye
If the world was ending, you'd come over, right? Right?
If the world was ending, you'd come over, right? Right?
You might also like
I tried to imagine your reaction
It didn't scare me when the earthquake happened
But it really got me thinkin', the night we went drinkin'
Stumbled in the house and didn't make it past the kitchen
Ah, it's been a year now, think I've figured out how
How to think about you without it rippin' my heart out


And I know, you know, we know you weren't
Down for forever and it's fine
I know, you know, we know we weren't
Meant for each other and it's fine


But if the world was ending, you'd come over, right?
You'd come over and you'd stay the night
Would you love me for the hell of it?

Quick, quick, tell me something awful
Like you are a poet trapped inside the body of a finance guy
Tell me all your secrets, all you'll ever be is
My eternal consolation prize
You see, I was a debutante in another life, but
Now I seem to be scared to go outside
If comfort is a construct, I don't believe in good luck
Now that I know what's what


I hate it here so I will go to secret gardens in my mind
People need a key to get to, the only one is mine
I read about it in a book when I was a precocious child
No mid-sized city hopes and small-town fears
I'm there most of the year 'cause I hate it here
I hate it here


My friends used to play a game where
We would pick a decade
We wished we could live in instead of this
I'd say the 1830s but without all the racists
And getting married off for the highest bid
Everyone would look down 'cause it wasn't fun now
Seems like it was never even fun back then
Nostalgia is a mind's trick
If I'd been there, I'd hate it
It was freezing in the palace
You might also like
I hate it here so I will go to lunar valleys in my mind
When they found a better planet, only the gentle survived
I dreamed about it in the dark, the night I felt like I might die
No mid-sized city hopes and small-town fears
I'm there most of the year 'cause I hate it here
I hate it here


I'm lonely, but I'm good
I'm bitter, but I swear I'm fine
I'll save all my romanticism for my inner life and I'll get lost on purpose
This place made me feel worthless
Lucid dreams like electricity, the current flies through me
And in my fantasies, I rise above it
And way up there, I actually love it


I hate it here so I will go to secret gardens in my mind
People need a key to get to, the only one is mine
I read about it in a book when I was a precocious child
No mid-sized city hopes and small-town fears

You stand with your hand on my waistline
It's a scene and we're out here in plain sight
I can hear them whisper as we pass by
It's a bad sign, bad sign
Somethin' happens when everybody finds out
See the vultures circlin', dark clouds
Love's a fragile little flame, it could burn out
It could burn out


'Cause they got the cages, they got the boxes and guns
They are the hunters, we are the foxes and we run


Baby, I know places we won't be found
And they'll be chasing their tails tryin' to track us down
'Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places, I know places


Lights flash and we'll run for the fences
Let them say what they want, we won't hear it

Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it, my love
They are the hunters, we are the foxes and we run


Baby (Baby), I know places we won't be found
And they'll (They'll) be (Be) chasing their tails tryin' to track us down
'Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places


They are the hunters, we are the foxes and we run
Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it, my love


Baby (Baby), I know places we won't be found
And they'll (They'll) be (Be) chasing their tails tryin' to track us down
'Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places


(I) They take their shots, but we're bulletproof (I know places)
(Hide) And you know, for me, it's always you (I know places)
(I) In the dead of night, your eyes so green (I know places)
(Hide) And I know, for you, it's always me (I know places)

To be young and in love in New York City
To not know who I am but still know that I'm good long as you're here with me
To be drunk and in love in New York City

I'd stay for a long time 'cause
I like me better when
I like me better when I'm with you




I don't know what it is, but I got that feelin'
Wakin' up in this bed next to you, swear the room, yeah, it got no ceilin'
If we lay, let the day just pass us by
I might get to too much talkin'
I might have to tell you somethin' (Damn)

Make sure nobody sees you leave
Hood over your head, keep your eyes down
Tell your friends you're out for a run
You’ll be flushed when you return
Take the road less traveled by
Tell yourself you can always stop
What started in beautiful rooms
Ends with meetings in parking lots


And that's the thing about illicit affairs
And clandestine meetings and longing stares
It's born from just one single glance
But it dies and it dies and it dies
A million little times


Leave the perfume on the shelf
That you picked out just for him
So you leave no trace behind
Like you don’t even exist
Take the words for what they are
A dwindling, mercurial high
A drug that only worked
The first few hundred times
You might also like
And that's the thing about illicit affairs
And clandestine meetings and stolen stares
They show their truth one single time
But they lie and they lie and they lie
A million little times


And you wanna scream
Don't call me "kid," don't call me "baby"
Look at this godforsaken mess that you made me
You showed me colors you know I can't see with anyone else
Don't call me "kid," don't call me "baby"
Look at this idiotic fool that you made me
You taught me a secret language I can't speak with anyone else


And you know damn well
For you, I would ruin myself

I had died the tiniest death
I spied the catch in your breath
Out, out, out, out, out, out
Northbound I got carried away
As you boarded your train
South, south, south, south, south, south


A feather taken by the wind blowing
I'm afflicted by the not knowing, so


I look in people's windows
Transfixed by rose golden glows
They have their friends over to drink nice wine
I look in people's windows
In case you're at their table
What if your eyes looked up and met mine
One more time?


You had stopped and tiltеd your head
I still ponder what it meant
Now, now, now, now, now, now
I triеd searching faces on streets
What are the chances you'd be
Downtown, downtown, downtown
You might also like
Does it feel alright to not know me?
I'm addicted to the "if only"


So I look in people's windows
Like I'm some deranged weirdo
I attend Christmas parties from outside
I look in people's windows
In case you're at their table
What if your eyes looked up and met mine

I just need someone in my life to give it structure
To handle all the selfish ways I'd spend my time without her
You're everything I want but I can't deal with all your lovers
You're saying I'm the one, but it's your actions that speak louder
Giving me love when you are down and need another
I've got to get away and let you go, I've got to get over


But I love you so (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
I love you so (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
I love you so (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
I love you so


I'm gonna pack my things and leave you behind
This feeling's old and I know that I've made up my mind
I hope you feel what I felt when you shattered my soul
'Cause you were cruel and I'm a fool, so please, let me go


But I love you so (Please, let me go)

Oh, there she goes again, every morning, it's the same
You walk on by my house, I wanna call out your name
I wanna tell you how beautiful you are from where I'm standin'
You got me thinkin' what we could be 'cause


I keep craving, craving, you don't know it but it's true
Can't get my mouth to say the words they wanna say to you
This is typical of love, can't wait anymore, won't wait
I need to tell you how I feel when I see us together forever


In my dreams, you're with me, we'll be everything I want us to be
And from there, who knows?
Maybe this will be the night that we kiss for the first time
Or is that just me and my imagination?


We walk, we laugh, we spend our time walking by the ocean side
Our hands are gently intertwined, a feeling I just can't describe
And all this time we spent alone thinkin' we cannot belong
To something so damn beautiful, so damn beautiful


I keep craving, craving, you don't know it but it's true
Can't get my mouth to say the words they wanna say to you

And I'll tell you one thing, honey
I can tell when somebody still wants me, come clean
Standin' at the bar like something's funny, bubbly
Once you fix your face, I'm goin' in (Yeah)

Whether I'm gonna curse you out or

I'm an Aston Martin that you steered straight into the ditch
Then ran and hid
And I'll tell you one thing, honey

I remember years ago
Someone told me I should take
Caution when it comes to love, I did
And you were strong and I was not
My illusion, my mistake
I was careless, I forgot, I did


And now
When all is done, there is nothing to say
You have gone and so effortlessly
You have won, you can go ahead tell them


Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the rooftops
Write it on the skyline
All we had is gone now
Tell them I was happy
And my heart is broken
All my scars are open
Tell them what I hoped would be

Ich hab' das, worauf sie warten
Ich renne vor nichts davon, Hund
Hol deine Soldaten, sag denen, dass ich mich nicht verstecke
Du warst eh nie auf meiner Seite
Wenn ich wieder oben bin, will ich euch sagen hören:
Er rennt vor nichts davon, Hund
Hol deine Soldaten, sag denen, dass die Pause vorbei ist


Ah, muss, ah

Brauch ein Paar Number Ones
Brauch 'ne Auszeichnung auf jedem Song
Brauch einen wie mit Nicki jetzt

Uh


How can I tell if I'm in the right relationship?
Aren't you really s'posed to know that shit?
Feel it in your bones and own that shit? I don't know
Then I had this interaction I've been thinkin' 'bout for like five weeks
Wonder if he's thinkin' 'bout it too and smiling
Wonder if he knows that that's been what's inspirin' me
Wonder if he's judgin' me like I am right now


I don't care
I'd rather tell the truth (Truth)
Than make it worse for you, mm (You)


If the sun refused to shine
Baby, would I still be your lover?
Would you want me there?
If the moon went dark tonight
And if it all ended tomorrow
Would I be the one on your mind, your mind, your mind?
And if it all ended tomorrow
Would you be the one on mine?You might also like4Embed

When you were standing in the wake of devastation
When you were waiting on the edge of the unknown
And with the cataclysm raining down, insides crying, "Save me now"
You were there, impossibly alone

Do you feel cold and lost in desperation?
You build up hope, but failure's all you've known
Remember all the sadness and frustration
And let it go, let it go

And in a burst of light that blinded every angel
As if the sky had blown the heavens into stars
You felt the gravity of tempered grace falling into empty space
No one there to catch you in their arms


Do you feel cold and lost in desperation?
You build up hope, but failure's all you've known
Remember all the sadness and frustration
And let it go, let it go


Do you feel cold and lost in desperation?
You build up hope, but failure's all you've known
Remember all the sadness and frustration
And let it go

(Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it?)


Once the flight had flown (Uh-huh)
With the wilt of the rose (Uh-huh)
I slept all alone (Uh-huh)
You still wouldn't go


Let's fast forward to three hundred takeout coffees later
I see your profile and your smile on unsuspecting waiters
You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor
You search in every maiden's bed for somethin' greater, baby


Was it over when she laid down on your couch?
Was it over when he unbuttoned my blouse?
"Come here," I whispered in your ear
In your dream as you passеd out, baby
Was it over then? And is it over now?


(Is it? Is it? Is it?)


Whеn you lost control (Uh-huh)
Red blood, white snow (Uh-huh)
Blue dress on a boat (Uh-huh)
Your new girl is my clone
You might also like
And did you think I didn't see you?
There were flashin' lights
At least I had the decency
To keep my nights out of sight
Only rumors 'bout my hips and thighs
And my whispered sighs
Oh, Lord, I think about jumpin'
Off of very tall somethings
Just to see you come runnin'
And say the one thing I've been wanting, but no


Let's fast forward to three hundred awkward blind dates later (Oh)
If she's got blue eyes, I will surmise that you'll probably date her (Oh, no)
You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor (Oh)
You search in every model's bed for somethin' greater, baby


Was it over when she laid down on your couch?
Was it over when he unbuttoned my blouse?
"Come here," I whispered in your ear
In your dream as you passed out, baby
Was it over then? And is it over now?

How's one to know?
I'd meet you where the spirit meets the bones
In a faith-forgotten land
In from the snow
Your touch brought forth an incandescent glow
Tarnished but so grand


And the old widow goes to the stone every day
But I don't, I just sit here and wait
Grieving for the living


Oh, goddamn
My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand
Taking mine, but it's been promised to another
Oh, I can't
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
My house of stone, your ivy grows
And now I'm covered in you


I wish to know
The fatal flaw that makes you long to be
Magnificently cursed

Your opal eyes are all I wish to see
He wants what's only yours

What would he do if he found us out?
Crescent moon, coast is clear
Spring breaks loose, but so does fear
He's gonna burn this house to the ground

I'd live and die for moments that we stole
On begged and borrowed time
So tell me to run
Or dare to sit and watch what we'll become
And drink my husband's wine

It's 2 AM in your car
Windows down, you pass my street, the memories start
You say, "It's in the past," you drive straight ahead
You're thinkin' that I hate you now
'Cause you still don't know what I never said


I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did, I
Wish you knew that
I'll never forget you as long as I live and I
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would


It's 2 AM in my room
Headlights pass the window pane, I think of you
We're a crooked love in a straight line down
Makes you want to run and hide
Then it makes you turn right back around


I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did, I
Wish you knew that
I'll never forget you as long as I live and I
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would

When I look into your eyes

छुपा है कोई रंज फ़िज़ा की चिलमन में


सारे सहमे नज़ारे हैं
सोए-सोए वक़्त के धारे हैं
और दिल में खोई-खोई सी बातें हैं


हो-ओ, कहने को जश्न-ए-बहाराँ है
इश्क़ ये देख के हैराँ है
फूल से ख़ुशबू ख़फ़ा-ख़फ़ा है गुलशन में
छुपा है कोई रंज फ़िज़ा की चिलमन में


कैसे कहें, क्या है सितम, सोचते हैं अब ये हम
कोई कैसे कहे, वो हैं या नहीं हमारे?
करते तो हैं साथ सफ़र, फ़ासले हैं फ़िर भी, मगर
जैसे मिलते नहीं किसी दरिया के दो किनारे
पास हैं फ़िर भी पास नहीं, हमको ये ग़म रास नहीं
शीशे की इक दीवार है जैसे दरमियाँ

मैं हूँ गुमसुम, तू भी खामोश है
सच है, समय का ही सब दोष है

है ज़िंदगी माना दर्द भरी
फिर भी इसमें ये राहत भी है
मैं हूँ तेरा और तू है मेरी
यूँ ही रहें हम, ये चाहत भी है

This rainy day is temporary
The contrast is why we got 'em
'Cause sun shining through is just a cloud
Away, way, way, way, way, way
Way, way, way (Hey, baby), way, way, way, way


So what? You've blown a fuse (You've blown a fuse)
Well, that happens to us all (That happens to us all)
Well, I come with great news (I come with great news)
The day could change (Change), change (Change)
Change (Change), change (Change)


We've all, of course, been there before
Been there cryin', fightin' the dark
Let good energy be, you're strong
Blow it away, way, way, way


This rainy day is temporary
The contrast is why we got 'em
The sun shining through is just a cloud
Away, way, way, way, way, way
Way, way, way (Hey, baby), way, way, way, way

Feels like singin' the blues (Feels like singin' the blues)
Don't abandon that song (Don't abandon that song)

We had made love earlier that day with no strings attached
But I could tell that something had changed, how you looked at me then

And I'm taking pictures of you with flowers on the wall

कभी-कभी अदिती ज़िंदगी में यूँही कोई अपना लगता है
कभी-कभी अदिती वो बिछड़ जाए तो एक सपना लगता है
ऐसे में कोई कैसे अपने आँसुओ को बेहेने से रोके
और कैसे कोई सोचदे everything gonna be okay

कभी-कभी तो लगे ज़िंदगी में रही ना ख़ुशी और ना मज़ा
कभी-कभी तो लगे हर दिन मुश्किल और हर पल एक सज़ा
ऐसे में कोई कैसे मुस्कुराए, कैसे हँस दे ख़ुश होके
और कैसे कोई सोचदे everything gonna be okay




सोच ज़रा जाने-ए-जां तुझको हमे कितना चाहते हैं
रोते हम भी अगर तेरे आँखों में आँसू आते हैं
गाना तो आता नहीं है मगर फिर भी गाते हैं
हे अदिती मान कभी, कभी सारे जहाँ में अँधेरा होता है
लेकिन रात के बाद ही तो सवेरा होता है

कभी-कभी अदिती ज़िंदगी में यूँही कोई अपना लगता है
कभी-कभी अदिती वो बिछड़ जाए तो एक सपना लगता है
ऐसे में कोई कैसे अपने आँसुओ को बेहेने से रोके
और कैसे कोई सोचदे everything gonna be okay

कभी-कभी तो लगे ज़िंदगी में रही ना ख़ुशी और ना मज़ा
कभी-कभी तो लगे हर दिन मुश्किल और हर पल एक सज़ा
ऐसे में कोई कैसे मुस्कुराए, कैसे हँस दे ख़ुश होके
और कैसे कोई सोचदे everything gonna be okay




सोच ज़रा जाने-ए-जां तुझको हमे कितना चाहते हैं
रोते हम भी अगर तेरे आँखों में आँसू आते हैं
गाना तो आता नहीं है मगर फिर भी गाते हैं
हे अदिती मान कभी, कभी सारे जहाँ में अँधेरा होता है
लेकिन रात के बाद ही तो सवेरा होता है


कभी-कभी अदिती ज़िंदगी में यूँही कोई अपना लगता है
कभी-कभी अदिती वो बिछड़ जाए तो एक सपना लगता है
हे अदिती हँस दे, हँस दे, हँस दे, हँस दे, हँस दे तू ज़रा
नहीं तो बस थोडा-थोडा-थोडा-थोडा-थोडा-थोडा मुस्कुरा




तू ख़ुश है तो लगे के जहाँ में छायी है ख़ुशी
सूरज निकले बादलों से और बातें ज़िंदगी
सुन तो ज़रा मदहोश हवा तुझसे कहने लगी
के अदिती वो जो बिछड़ते हैं एक ना एक दिन फिर मिल जाते
अदिती जाने तू या जाने ना फूल फिर खिल जाते हैं


कभी-कभी अदिती ज़िंदगी में यूँही कोई अपना लगता है
कभी-कभी अदिती वो बिछड़ जाए तो एक सपना लगता है
हे अदिती हँस दे, हँस दे, हँस दे, हँस दे, हँस दे तू ज़रा
नहीं तो बस थोडा-थोडा-थोडा-थोडा-थोडा-थोडा मुस्कुरा


हे अदिती हँस दे, हँस दे, हँस दे, हँस दे, हँस दे तू ज़रा
नहीं तो बस थोडा-थोडा-थोडा-थोडा-थोडा-थोडा मुस्कुरा
हे अदिती हँस दे, हँस दे, हँस दे, हँस दे, हँस दे तू ज़रा

Te escribí lo que sentía y lo borré
Te dije que no te amaba y lo arruiné
Sabiendo que
Cuando te ibas, solo quería besarte
Me acuerdo cuando de tu casa me fui
Dije que "no" queriendo decir que "sí"
Pero sentí tu duda y me trajo la duda
Por eso estamos aquí


Me dices que pa' qué y yo te digo que
Si no somos nada, ¿entonces a qué
Estamos jugando? El tiempo volando
Y tú sin mí no sé si bien la estás pasando
Me dices que pa' qué y yo tе digo que
¿Pa' qué nos mentimos? Si en еl fondo se
Te nota tanto que te está matando
Decir que ahora sin mí mejor la estás pasando


Yo fronteando me hice el fuerte y me apeché
Tú queriendo ser mi amiga y te besé
Sabes muy bien
Que no podemos controlar los sentimientos
Y llamo a otras pa' olvidarme de ti
Pero en mi mente yo te tengo en repeat
Más que una calentura, baby, tú disimulas

Makin' Mama so proud, but your voice is too loud
We like to watch you laughin'
You pick the insects off plants, no time to think of consequences


Control yourself, take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanted to be haunted
Control yourself, take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanted to be haunted


The water is warm, but it's sendin' me shivers
A baby is born, cryin' out for attention
The memories fade like lookin' through a fogged mirror
Decision to decisions are made and not bought
But I thought this wouldn't hurt a lot, I guess not


Control yourself, take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanted to be haunted
Control yourself, take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanted to be haunted




Control yourself, take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanted to be haunted
Control yourself, take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanted to be haunted
Control yourself, take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanted to be haunted
Control yourself, take only what you need from it

His new girlfriend's next, how'd I get here?
I might kill my ex, I still love him though
Rather be in jail than alone


I get the sense that it's a lost cause
I get the sense that you might really love her
This text gon' be evidence, this text is evidence
I tried to ration with you, no murders or crime of passion, but damn

Przytulamy się i, tak, kochamy

Ale potrzebuję twoich ust na moich


Czy możesz mnie więcej pocałować?
Jesteśmy tacy młodzi, chłopcze, nie mamy nic do stracenia, oh-oh
To tylko zasada
Kochanie, przytul mnie, bo podoba mi się sposób, w jaki się rowujesz, oh-oh

Och, uwielbiam ten smak, la-la-la-la-la-la

Ja, czuję się jak kurwa coś
Ale moglibyśmy być ckli, pieprzyć to
Cukier, nie jestem głupkiem, głupkiem
Lubię mówić, "A co jeśli?" Ale jeśli
Moglibyśmy się pocałować i po prostu pokroić śmieci
Wtedy mogę być na czymś
Nie dam ci jеdnego publicznie
Daję ci setki, piеprzyć to
Coś, w co po prostu musimy się dostać
Znak pierwszy, środkowy, ostatni na zębie mądrości
Czarnuchy żałują, że cipka jest budką do pocałunku
Spróbuj śniadania, lunchu, ginu i soku
I ta kolacja też jak deser
A kiedy my Francuzi, odśwież, daj mi dwa
Kiedy przygryzę tę wargę, przyjdź po mnie też
Chce szminkę, błyszczyk do ust, malinkę też, huh

There's a stranger in my bed
There's a pounding in my head
Glitter all over the room
Pink flamingos in the pool
I smell like a minibar
DJ's passed out in the yard
Barbies on the barbecue
This a hickey or a bruise?

I'm screwed, oh well
It's a blacked-out blur, but I'm pretty sure it ruled
Damn


Last Friday night, yeah, we danced on tabletops
And we took too many shots, think we kissed, but I forgot
Last Friday night, yeah, we maxed our credit cards
And got kicked out of the bar, so we hit the boulevard
Last Friday night, we went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark then had a ménage à trois
Last Friday night, yeah, I think we broke the law
Always say we're gonna stop-op, oh-woah

Well, you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go


And you let her go


Staring at the bottom of your glass
Hoping one day you'll make a dream last
But dreams come slow and they go so fast
You see her when you close your eyes
Maybe one day you'll understand why
Everything you touch surely dies


But you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go
You might also like
Staring at the ceiling in the dark
Same old empty feeling in your heart
'Cause love comes slow and it goes so fast
Well, you see her when you fall asleep
But never to touch and never to keep
'Cause you loved her too much and you dived too deep


Well, you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go


And you let her go, oh, woah, mm, oh
And you let her go, oh, woah, uh, no
Well, you let her go


'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go

'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home

Eu tenho que, eu tenho que, eu tenho que me decidir
Eu não vou ralar, vou brilhar até o meu tempo acabar
Eu tenho dinheiro na minha cabeça, isso é um crime, yo?
Não quero voltar aos dias em que eu estava falido
Mas, garota, você é a minha prioridade (Woo)
E eu vou colocar o seu coração acima de mim
E o dinheiro não é nada se eu não estiver com você, amor
Abandono tudo só pra ter você de volta
Não posso colocar um preço no que tínhamos (Ooh)


Eles dizem, "Tempo é dinheiro", mas o dinheiro não pode fazer tempo (Fazer tempo)
Às vezes está ensolarado, mas às vezes não brilha (Não, não brilha)
E a vida é uma merda, mas às vezes está tudo bem (Está tudo bem)
Então eu vou deixar pra lá as coisas que eu não consigo controlar


Deixar pra lá (Oh-oh-oh), deixar pra lá (Oh-oh-oh)

Não tô tentando agir como se eu fosse lento, porque você andou pelo quarteirão e eu sei disso com certeza (21)

Agora eu só trafico, ralo e empilho até que todos os meus músculos estejam doloridos (Por Deus)
Não pratico esporte, mas eu brilho (21), atenda o telefone quando eu ligar (21)
Eu me levanto sempre que caio, não me provoque, vai acabar em uma briga (Por Deus)
As luzes do Porsche se parecem com um sapo (Um sapo), custaram uma grana, isso é tudo (Isso é tudo)
O Richard Mille senta no meu pulso, eu tô rico pra sempre, não faço coisa pequena (Por Deus)
Bunda tão grande, não consegue sentar
A mina tem uma carga nas costas como se fosse uma caminhonete
250 mil dólares toda vez que eu faço o saque
Os fãs estão com os braços pro alto como se fosse um assalto (21)
O dinheiro tá crescendo como se tivesse sido plantado (21)
Você sabe que é um pouco de droga se eu agitar (Pra cima)
Tempo é dinheiro, gata, você é linda
Eu não tenho escolha a não ser te dar uma gorjeta (21, ooh)

This night is cold in the kingdom
I can feel you fade away
From the kitchen to the bathroom sink and
Your steps keep me awake


Don't cut me down, throw me out, leave me here to waste
I once was a man with dignity and grace
Now I'm slipping through the cracks of your cold embrace
So please, please


Could you find a way to let me down slowly?
A little sympathy, I hope you can show me
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly
Let me down, down
Let me down, down
Let me down, let me down
Down, let me down, down
Let me down
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly


Cold skin, drag my feet on the tile
As I'm walking down the corridor
And I know we haven't talked in a while
So I'm looking for an open door

Don't waste your eyes on jealous guys, fuck that noise

You need a pick me up?
I'll be there in twenty-five

And forget in the mornin'
Play me a song that you like
You can bet I'll know every line
I'm the boy that your boy hoped that you would avoid
Don't waste your eyes on jealous guys, fuck that noise
I know better than to call you mine


You need a pick me up?
I'll be there in twenty-five
I like to push my luck
So take my hand, let's take a drive
I've been livin' in the future
Hopin' I might see you sooner
I want you riding shotgun
I knew when I got one right


Let's fall in love for the night
And forget in the mornin'
Play me a song that you like
You can bet I'll know every line
I'm the boy that your boy hoped that you would avoid
Don't waste your eyes on jealous guys, fuck that noise
I know better than to call you mine
You might also like
I love it when you talk that nerdy shit
We're in our twenties talking thirties shit
We're making money but we're savin' it
'Cause talking shit is cheap and we talk a lot of it
You won't stay with me, I know
But you can have your way with me 'til you go
And before your kisses turn into bruises, I'm a warning


Let's fall in love for the night
And forget in the mornin'
Play me a song that you like
You can bet I'll know every line
'Cause I'm the boy that your boy hoped that you would avoid
Don't waste your eyes on jealous guys, fuck that noise
I know better, I know better
I know better than to ever call you mine61Embed

Let's drive out to the desert at midnight
To dance in the dust of our headlights
And score some good seats for the sunrise
And dress up in clothes we don’t mind getting messed up
Where no one will know how to get us
We don’t need a map we'll just drive, drive, drive


I wanna get lost with you
And hide out out under the light of the moon
I wanna get lost with you
And see what it's like
To spend the whole night with you, just you
You, just you


We can head north over the oceans of turquoise
Where after awhile there'll be no noise
Except for the sound of our heartbeats beating on
And we'll stand in a canyon alone
Singing our favorite songs
And wait for the words to return
In the echo echo echo echo echo echo


I wanna get lost with you
And hide out out under the light of the moon
I wanna get lost with you
And see what it's like to spend the whole night with you, just you

Do you love it when you keep me guessin' (Me guessin')
When you're leaving then you leave me stressin'? (Me stressin')
But I can't stay mad when you walk like that, no

But I go right back and


All the sudden, I'm hypnotized (Hypnotized)

Чёрт, ниггер, каждый раз, когда я смотрю на тебя, клянусь Богом

Дала мне любви и нежности
Внимания (Давай), прикрытия

Я бы никогда тебя не судил
Ведь всё и так получилось без него (Как что?)

Ты никогда не станешь лгать мне
Я уже стал тем, кем хотел бы быть
Так я выгляжу как он?

Это была моя вина, не твоя, не его, моя вина
Прости меня
Знаешь, это была моя вина
Не его, потому что он всегда хотел быть рядом с тобой
И прости меня что я была молода, но он всегда хотел быть отцом ради тебя
И я-я облажалась и взялась за это, за мои выборы и решения и я извиняюсь за это
Он был хорошим парнем
Так что не злись на него, потому что это была моя вина

Зажгу косяк в этой суке
Метро, Метро, Метро, три раза
Йеа


Следуем кодексу, все эти шлюхи созданы для улиц
Засунул ей в нос, теперь её киска потечёт
Ссыкуны стуканули, не увидят света дня
Может, щелчка и не слышно, но слышно, как эти челы вопят
Все мои шлюшки под грибами, бля, все мои шлюшки под коксом
Кольцо двадцать карат, засунул пальцы ей глубоко в рот (А, а, а)
Если карат пропадёт, она удавится (А, а, а)
Я знаю, она сглотнёт, она в этом G.O.A.T. (А, а, а)
Freeband, на хуй, тащи бабки сюда
Мои стрелки в углу, стоят стаей
Она думает, что она экзотическая сучка и поэтому красива
Из-за такого дерьма тебя вынесут на районе, брр
И девиз у нас всё тот же
Шикую, будто выиграл игру за чемпионство
Ты знаешь, как эти шлюхи голодны, они трахнутся за статус
Подтянул её в банду, она трахнулась за цепь
Твоя девка в этой суке, она вертится на члене
У меня сироп в этой суке, тусим в этой суке
Мы принесли Перки в эту суку, наебашимсь в этой суке
Вся эта ювелирка на мне, детка, ну что ж, время поиграть
Зови подружку, сучка, мы трахнем их одновременно
Я на другом уровне, нет, мы не одной породы
Можешь взять ту малую, если её ещё не взял я (Йеа)

Who's gonna stop us from waltzing back into rekindled flames
If we know the steps anyway?
We embroidered the memories of the time I was away
Stitching, "We were just kids, babe"
I said, "I don't mind, it takes time"
I thought I was better safe than starry-eyed
I felt aglow like this
Never before and never since


If you know it in one glimpse, it's legendary
You and I go from one kiss to getting married
Still alivе, killing time at the cemеtery
Never quite buried
In your suit and tie, in the nick of time
You low-down boy, you stand-up guy
You Holy Ghost, you told me I'm the love of your life
You said I'm the love of your life
About a million times


Who's gonna tell me the truth when you blew in with the winds of fate
And told me I reformed you?
When your impressionist paintings of heaven turned out to be fakes
Well, you took me to hell too
And all at once, the ink bleeds
A con man sells a fool a get-love-quick scheme
But I've felt a hole like this
Never before and ever since
You might also like
If you know it in one glimpse, it's legendary
What we thought was for all time was momentary
Still alive, killing time at the cemetery
Never quite buried
You cinephile in black and white
All those plot twists and dynamite
Mr. Steal Your Girl, then make her cry
You said I'm the love of your life


You shit-talked me under the table
Talkin' rings and talkin' cradles
I wish I could un-recall
How we almost had it all
Dancing phantoms on the terrace
Are they second-hand embarrassed
That I can't get out of bed
'Cause something counterfeit's dead?
It was legendary
It was momentary
It was unnecessary
Should've let it stay buried


Oh, what a valiant roar
What a bland goodbye
The coward claimed he was a lion
I'm combing through the braids of lies
"I'll never leave," "Never mind"
Our field of dreams engulfed in fire
Your arson's match, your somber eyes
And I'll still see it until I die
You're the loss of my life6Embed

It was legendary
It was momentary
It was unnecessary
Should've let it stay buried


Oh, what a valiant roar
What a bland goodbye
The coward claimed he was a lion
I'm combing through the braids of lies
"I'll never leave," "Never mind"
Our field of dreams engulfed in fire
Your arson's match, your somber eyes
And I'll still see it until I die
You're the loss of my life","['nostalgia', 'romance', 'adventure']"

We can go drivin' in, on my scooter
Uh, you know, just 'round London (Oh, I'd—)


I love my hometown as much as Motown, I love SoCal
And you know I love Springsteen, faded blue jeans, Tennessee whiskey
But somethin' happened, I heard him laughin'
I saw the dimples first and then I heard the accent


They say, "Home is where the heart is"
But that's not where mine lives


You know I love a London boy
I enjoy walkin' Camden Market in the afternoon
He likes my American smile, like a child when our eyes meet
Darling, I fancy you
Took me back to Highgate, met all of his best mates
So I guess all the rumors are true
You know I love a London boy
Boy, I fancy you (Ooh)


And now I love high tea, stories from Uni' and the West End
You can find me in the pub, we are watchin' rugby with his school friends
Show me a gray sky, a rainy cab ride
Babes, don't threaten me with a good time
You might also like
They say, "Home is where the heart is"
But, God, I love the English


You know I love a London boy
I enjoy nights in Brixton, Shoreditch in the afternoon
He likes my American smile, like a child when our eyes meet
Darling, I fancy you
Took me back to Highgate, met all of his best mates
So I guess all the rumors are true
You know I love a London boy
Boy, I fancy you


So please show me Hackney
Doesn't have to be Louis V up on Bond Street
Just wanna be with you

Stick with me, I'm your queen
Like a Tennessee Stella McCartney on the Heath
Just wanna be with you (Wanna be with you)
Wanna be with you, oh, woah


You know I love a London boy

I said, "Remember this moment"
In the back of my mind
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds in stands went wild
We were the kings and the queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew our lives
Would never be the same
You held your head like a hero
On a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age


Long live the walls we crashеd through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was scrеaming, "Long live all the magic we made"
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered


I said, "Remember this feeling"
I pass the pictures around
Of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines
Wishin' for right now
We are the kings and the queens
You traded your baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies
And we held them up for our town
And the cynics were outraged
Screaming, "This is absurd"
'Cause for a moment, a band of thieves
In ripped up jeans got to rule the world
You might also like
Long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, "Long live all the magic we made"
And bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid
Long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
I was screaming, "Long live that look on your face"
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered


Hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall
Will you take a moment? Promise me this
That you'll stand by me forever
But if, God forbid, fate should step in
And force us into a goodbye
If you have children some day
When they point to the pictures
Please, tell 'em my name
Tell 'em how the crowds went wild
Tell 'em how I hope they shine
Long live the walls we crashed through
I had the time of my life with you

Long, long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
And I was screaming, "Long live all the magic we made"
And bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid

Sapna tha tu mera, main tujhko hasil karun
Lagta na bin tere dil, ab iska kya karun
Beetega har sama bas ,teri hi yaad mein
Tu meri justjoo, tu meri aarzoo


Jaane kahan kho sa gaya tu?
Lauta na aisa gaya tu
Khwaabon sa ho sa gaya tu
Rahon se ab mud ja na
Mujhpe yeh qarz chadha de
Tu mera dard badha de
Ya de aaram mujhe
Zakhmon ka marham banja na


Coming home, long time no see
Ab dekhein tujhe roz he
Khuda de to main likhoon
Music mere liye ban chuki hai rozi
Jab chahe aamad ho, jab chahe nahin
Duniyaan bolti rahe mujhe, main ro bhi nahin
Uss toote hue ghar ki tasveer dekh
Uss tasveer mein abb tu bhi nahin, aur main bhi nahin
Toh kitne dard mile honge tujhe meri wajah se
Tu aaye jis jagah chale jaaye hum uss jagah se
Izzat ko lena dena duniyaan ka dastoor samjha hain
I was right there par tune mujhe door samjha hain
You said, you're gonna be with me for life, girl
Ab main khud par taan kar baitha hoon rifle
This broken heart hurts so much, man
Kabhi kabhi khayal aaye suicidal
Kyunki humne tujhse baat karna chhod di hai
Haath par khoon, ghar ki cheezein maine tod di hain
She's gone, use na roko, woh ja chuki hai
Toofan ki alaamat hai ye khaamoshi
Ye baarishein chhupa de mere aansu
Lage aishe jaise boondein meri aankhon mein hi aa basin
Main kaam karoon lagan se, no one has ever felt

Something's got a hold of me lately
No, I don’t know myself anymore
Feels like the walls are all closin' in
And the devil's knockin’ at my door, woah
Out of my mind, how many times did I tell you
I'm no good at bein' alone?
Yeah, it's taken a toll on me, tryin' my best to keep
From tearin' the skin off my bones, don't you know

I lose control
When you're not next to me
I’m fallin’ apart right in front of you, can't you see?
I lose control
When you’re not next to me, mhm
Yeah, you're breakin' my heart, baby
You make a mess of me


Problematic
The problem is I want your body like a fiend, like a bad habit
Bad habits hard to break when I'm with you
Yeah, I know I can do it on my own
But I want that real full-moon black magic and it takes two
Problematic
The problem is when I’m with you I'm an addict
And I need some relief, my skin in your teeth
Can't see the forest through the trees
Got me down on my knees, darlin', please, oh

Baby, you were the love of my life, woah
Maybe you don't know what's lost till you find it


Take a walk on Sunday through the afternoon
We can always find somethin' for us to do
We don't really like what's on the news, but it's on all the time
I take you with me every time I go away
In a hotel, usin' someone else's name
I remember back at Jonny's place, it's not the same anymore


Baby, you were the love of my life, woah
Maybe you don't know what's lost till you find it
It's not what I wantеd, to leave you behind
Don't know whеre you'll land when you fly
But, ​baby, you were the love of my life


It's unfortunate (Ooh)
Just coordinates (Ooh)


I don't know you half as well as all my friends
I won't pretend that I've been doin' everything I can
To get to know your creases and your ends
Are they the same?

We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
And this is our place, we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear
Have I known you twenty seconds or twenty years?

Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out and take me home
You're my, my, my, my lover


We could let our friends crash in the living room
This is our place, we make the call
And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you
I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all

Can I go where you go?

Take me out and take me home (Forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my lover

Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover

We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, "Hello"
Little did I know


That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, "Please don't go," and I said


Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"


So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh
You might also like
'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, "Please don't go," and I said


Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"


Oh, oh


But I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town


And I said, "Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think"
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said
"Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say, 'Yes'"

For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl, for goodness' sake
You think I'm cryin' on my own, well, I ain't


And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't, but you still hit my phone up
And baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that


My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own


'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from

I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
I never felt so low and I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?

Ritz-i narkotik bazarına çevirdim
Elə bil hoteli 4 dəfə evakuasiya etmişəm
Gəl, heç nəyi vecə alma, kərpicləri sök çıxar
Gəl qızım, dizlərinin üstünə necə çökdüyünü göstər
Və bütün bədənimin dünyadan qopduğunu hiss edirəm
Kim ayaqlarını daha geniş aralayıbsa onu becərirəm
West Side-dan olan qızlarla birgə yaşıl çəkirəm
East Coast, North Side-ı təmsil edirəm
Heç vaxt qəhbənin vaxtını boşa xərcləmirəm (Freebands)
Qancıq, indi mənim vaxtımdır
Başqa biriylə iş görməyi sikim
Mütəmadi olaraq telefon nömrəmi və xəttimi dəyişdirirəm
Balam, mən yalan danışmıram
Əvvəl ev üçün pulum yox idi
İndi otağıma gələn servis hesabı bütün ömrüvə başa gələr
Əgər mənə hünər göstərməyə çalışsalar tamamilə hərbi rejimə keçərəm
Tam kamuflyaj geydim, sanki ordudayam
Və dəmir barmaqlıqlar arxasında olan dostlarımı sərbəst buraxıram

Oyandıqdan sonra Ace of Spade-dən su kimi bir qurtum içirəm
Qızınla birgə molly və Xans qəbul edirəm
Əgər qız ona xəyanət etdiyimi tutsa, heç vaxt ona peşman olduğumu deməyəcəm
Əgər qız ona xəyanət etdiyimi tutsa, heç vaxt ona peşman olduğumu deməyəcəm
Porsche-u dağların təpəsində saxlamışam, Bentley-lərim və Ferrari-lərim var
Təyyarədə ağrı kəsici dərmanlar partladıram, davamlı olaraq kirayələnirəm
Dalbadal alış-verişə çıxdığıma görə acından ölürəm
Qancıq, məndə hörmət də var, qısa tüfəng də
5 ulduzlu hoteli narkotik evinə çevirdim
Hər yeri həşərat basıb, sanki zibilləri atmağı yaddan çıxarmışıq
Xaçımı almazla çərçivələtdim, pul qazanmaq mənim dinimdir
Uşağımın anası ilə saxladığım qəhbəni öpüşdürdüm
Ritz-i lean evinə çevirdim
Artıq altıncı dəfədir ki bizi oteldən atırlar
Üzümü hiss edə bilmirəm, damarlarımda Adderal gəzir, ürəyim bulanır
Bicbalalar mənim dalğamı oğurlamaq istəyir, hamısı əlimdən yanıqlıdır
Edilən şeyi oğurlamaq səni tez öldürər
Ricky kimi arxandan vurarlar səni
Lil Mexico, mən həyatda olmayanda o biri dünyanı gördüm
Bütün həyatım boyu, bütün həyatım boyu...

Bir az molly atdım, başqa nə var? (Hey)
Yanımızda Follies-dən  2-3 dənə qəhbə var
Bir azdan qız dəstəylə sikişəcək, başqa nə var? (Vallah)
Mən onun rəfiqələrini sikəcəm, başqa nə var? (Sik, sik)
Qancıq Pakistanlıdır, nə var nə yox? (Xaricidir)
Ferrari-lər və Lambo-lar başqa nə var? (skrrrt)
Bir azdan bu klubun altını üstünə gətirəcəyik, başqa nə var? (Gətir, gətir)
Metro Boomin want some more, nigga!


Ritz-i narkotik bazarına çevirdim
Elə bil hoteli 4 dəfə evakuasiya etmişəm
Gəl, heç nəyi vecə alma, kərpicləri sök çıxar
Gəl qızım, dizlərinin üstünə necə çökdüyünü göstər
Və bütün bədənimin dünyadan qopduğunu hiss edirəm
Kim ayaqlarını daha geniş aralayıbsa onu becərirəm
West Side-dan olan qızlarla birgə yaşıl çəkirəm
East Coast, North Side-ı təmsil edirəm
Heç vaxt qəhbənin vaxtını boşa xərcləmirəm (Freebands)
Qancıq, indi mənim vaxtımdır
Başqa biriylə iş görməyi sikim
Mütəmadi olaraq telefon nömrəmi və xəttimi dəyişdirirəm
Balam, mən yalan danışmıram
Əvvəl ev üçün pulum yox idi
İndi otağıma gələn servis hesabı bütün ömrüvə başa gələr
Əgər mənə hünər göstərməyə çalışsalar tamamilə hərbi rejimə keçərəm
Tam kamuflyaj geydim, sanki ordudayam
Və dəmir barmaqlıqlar arxasında olan dostlarımı sərbəst buraxıram
Çünki mən həmişə səfil həyatı təmsil edirəm


Səfil həyatı təmsil edirəm
Səfil həyat, səfil həyat, səfil həyat (Yandır)
Bu səfil həyatı təmsil edirəm (Nümayəndəyəm, nümayəndəyəm, nümayəndəyəm)
Dedim, bu səfil həyatı təmsil edirəm
Səfil həyatı, səfil həyatı, səfil həyatı (Bu səfil həyatın nümayəndəsiyəm)
Dedim ki, bu səfil həyatı təmsil edirəm (Təmsil edirəm, təmsil edirəm, təmsil edirəm)

Oyandıqdan sonra Ace of Spade-dən su kimi bir qurtum içirəm
Qızınla birgə molly və Xans qəbul edirəm
Əgər qız ona xəyanət etdiyimi tutsa, heç vaxt ona peşman olduğumu deməyəcəm
Əgər qız ona xəyanət etdiyimi tutsa, heç vaxt ona peşman olduğumu deməyəcəm
Porsche-u dağların təpəsində saxlamışam, Bentley-lərim və Ferrari-lərim var
Təyyarədə ağrı kəsici dərmanlar partladıram, davamlı olaraq kirayələnirəm
Dalbadal alış-verişə çıxdığıma görə acından ölürəm
Qancıq, məndə hörmət də var, qısa tüfəng də
5 ulduzlu hoteli narkotik evinə çevirdim
Hər yeri həşərat basıb, sanki zibilləri atmağı yaddan çıxarmışıq
Xaçımı almazla çərçivələtdim, pul qazanmaq mənim dinimdir
Uşağımın anası ilə saxladığım qəhbəni öpüşdürdüm
Ritz-i lean evinə çevirdim
Artıq altıncı dəfədir ki bizi oteldən atırlar
Üzümü hiss edə bilmirəm, damarlarımda Adderal gəzir, ürəyim bulanır
Bicbalalar mənim dalğamı oğurlamaq istəyir, hamısı əlimdən yanıqlıdır
Edilən şeyi oğurlamaq səni tez öldürər
Ricky kimi arxandan vurarlar səni
Lil Mexico, mən həyatda olmayanda o biri dünyanı gördüm
Bütün həyatım boyu, bütün həyatım boyu...


Səfil həyatı təmsil edirəm
Səfil həyat, səfil həyat, səfil həyat (Yandır)
Bu səfil həyatı təmsil edirəm (Nümayəndəyəm, nümayəndəyəm, nümayəndəyəm)
Dedim, bu səfil həyatı təmsil edirəm
Səfil həyatı, səfil həyatı, səfil həyatı (Bu səfil həyatın nümayəndəsiyəm)
Dedim ki, bu səfil həyatı təmsil edirəm (Təmsil edirəm, təmsil edirəm, təmsil edirəm)

Çün' bu oğlanın yanında 10 dənə tüfəng saxladığını bilirlər (10 dənə tüfəng)
Və bu oğlanın 10 dənə snayper tutduğunu bilirlər (10 dənə snayper)
Uşaq pampersi kimi içkini daim yanımızda gəzdiririk
Hə, onlar stereotiplərdir

I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you

Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me


You left me falling and landing inside my grave
I know that you want me dead
I take prescriptions to make me feel a-okay
I know it's all in my head
I have these lucid dreams where I can't move a thing
Thinking of you in my bed
You were my everything
Thoughts of a wedding ring
Now I'm just better off dead (Uh, uh, uh)
I'll do it over again
I didn't want it to end
I watch it blow in the wind
I should've listened to my friends
Leave this shit in the past, but I want it to last
You were made outta plastic, fake
I was tangled up in your drastic ways
Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?
You gave me a heart that was full of mistakes
I gave you my heart and you made heartbreak

I never came to the beach or stood by the ocean
I never sat by the shore under the sun with my feet in the sand
But you brought me here and I'm happy that you did
'Cause now I'm as free as birds catchin' the wind
I always thought I would sink, so I never swam
I never went boatin', don't get how they are floatin'
And sometimes I get so scared of what I can't understand


But here I am, next to you
The sky's more blue in Malibu
Next to you in Malibu
Next to you (Baby)


We watched the sun go down as we were walkin'
I'd spend the rest of my life just standing here talkin'
You would explain the current as I just smile
Hoping that you'll stay the same and nothing will change
And it'll be us just for a while, do they even exist?
That's when I make a wish to swim away with the fish
'Cause it's supposed to be this hot all summer long
I never would've believed you if three years ago you told me
I'd be here writing this song

Drinkin' out the bottle, gettin' twisted, Maruchan
Big exotic, Hermes, this a croc'
Watch too expensive, ain't no way I'm gettin' clocked
I think I'm so sexy, every shirt I own is cropped
So many karats, diamonds do the bunny hop (Ah)
In the US or Japan, if he meet me, he gon' bow
I got yеn for your friends, if they're prеtty, bring 'em out
Goin' dumb in Madam Woo, pourin' sake in their mouth

Singing with jewelry on
The stars gathered in the studio
Night after night, lots of alcohol at the hideout
Just finished recording on the radio in Roppongi
Then off to do TV shoots
Cameras chasing after us on ladders
Love the shiny diamonds
They shine in the dark every night
Greeting with a "Nice to meet you"
I'm so happy, grateful

Night after night, lots of alcohol at the hideout
Just finished recording on the radio in Roppongi
Then off to do TV shoots
Cameras chasing after us on ladders
Love the shiny diamonds
They shine in the dark every night
Greeting with a "Nice to meet you"
I'm so happy, grateful


I get money, I'm a star
Star, star, star, star, star, star
I get money, I'm a star
Star, star, star, star, star, star
We earn money, we're stars
I earn money, I'm a star
Star, star, star, star, sparkling
I am a star","['empowerment', 'self-love', 'adventure']"

Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty


This that pretty-girl mantra, this that flaunt ya, just touched down in L.A.​
Pretty girls don't do drama 'less we wanna, it'll be depending on the day
Pretty girls packed in a Defender, know I'ma defend her, never let her catch no stray
This that pretty-girl mantra, she's that stunna, make you wanna swing both ways


Mix me with the drama (Drama)
Check you like commas (Ah-ah, ah-ah)
My clothes are pajamas ('Jamas)
Straight from the cold plunge (Ah-ah, ah-ah)
Daytime baddie use her mind
Quick switch of the fit for the night (Night)
Swеrvin' through the lane, we'll bе twenty minute late
'Cause we had to do an In-N-Out drive-by


It's not that deep (Deep), I'm not that drunk (Drunk)
Sometimes, girls just gotta have fun
Throw it back, all that ass
Me and my sis, way too attached
It's not that deep (Deep), we're not that dumb (Dumb)
Look at them Bonnies on the run
Inside glowin' like the sun (Sun, s—)
You're gonna feel this every day (Day)

To be off of the grid like all night
Oh, with my bih, like (Bitch, like)
We ain't even tryna talk no one
Swerve off all the creeps, no weird vibes

Ain't nobody gon' dim our good light

Pretty girls that you gon' remember, know that you could never, nothing ever trigger me (Ah, ah)
This that pretty-girl mantra, she's that stunna, everyone knows she is me (Ah)

I promise that you'll never find another like me


I know that I'm a handful, baby, uh
I know I never think before I jump
And you're the kind of guy the ladies want
(And there's a lot of cool chicks out there)
I know that I went psycho on the phone
I never leave well enough alone
And trouble's gonna follow where I go
(And there's a lot of cool chicks out there)


But one of these things is not like the others
Like a rainbow with all of the colors
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover
I promise that you'll never find another like

Baby, that's the fun of me

And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e

I know I tend to make it about me
I know you never get just what you see
But I will never bore you, baby
(And there's a lot of lame guys out there)
And when we had that fight out in the rain
You ran after me and called my name
I never wanna see you walk away
(And there's a lot of lame guys out there)


'Cause one of these things is not like the others
Livin' in winter, I am your summer
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover
I promise that you'll never find another like


Me-e-e, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm the only one of me
Let me keep you company
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're the only one of you
Baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e

Hey, kids!

Girl there ain’t no “I” in team
But you know there is a "me"
Strike the band up, 1, 2, 3
I promise that you'll never find another like me
Girl, there ain't no I in "team"
But you know there is a "me"
And you can't spell "awesome" without "me"

Girl, there ain't no I in "team" (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
But you know there is a "me"
I'm the only one of me (Oh-oh)
Baby, that's the fun of me

You're the only one of you
Baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-eEmbed

I promise that you'll never find another like me


I know that I'm a handful, baby, uh
I know I never think before I jump
And you're the kind of guy the ladies want
(And there's a lot of cool chicks out there)
I know that I went psycho on the phone
I never leave well enough alone
And trouble's gonna follow where I go
(And there's a lot of cool chicks out there)


But one of these things is not like the others
Like a rainbow with all of the colors
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover
I promise that you'll never find another like


Me-e-e, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm the only one of me
Baby, that's the fun of me
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're the only one of you
Baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e


I know I tend to make it about me
I know you never get just what you see
But I will never bore you, baby
(And there's a lot of lame guys out there)
And when we had that fight out in the rain
You ran after me and called my name
I never wanna see you walk away
(And there's a lot of lame guys out there)


'Cause one of these things is not like the others
Livin' in winter, I am your summer
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover
I promise that you'll never find another like


Me-e-e, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm the only one of me
Let me keep you company
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're the only one of you
Baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e

Hey, kids!

When I believed in forever and everything would stay the same
Now my heart feel like December when somebody say your name
'Cause I can't reach out to call you, but I know I will one day, yeah


Everybody hurts sometimes
Everybody hurts someday, ayy-ayy
But everything gon' be alright
Go and raise a glass and say, ayy

It changes though now that I'm famous
Everyone knows how this lifestyle is dangerous
But I love it, the rush is amazin'
Celebrate nightly and everyone rages
I found how to cope with my angers
I'm swimmin' in money
Swimmin' in liquor, my liver is muddy
But it's all good, I'm still sippin' this bubbly
This shit is lovely, this shit ain't random, I didn't get lucky
Made it right here ‘cause I'm sick with it, cuddy
They all take the money for granted

And as far as I can see, I just need privacy
Plus a whole lot of tree, fuck all this modesty
I just need space to do me
Give the world what they're tryna see
A Stella Maxwell right beside of me
A Ferrari, I'm buyin' three
A closet of Saint Laurent, get what I want when I want
'Cause this hunger is drivin' me, yeah
I just need to be alone, I just need to be at home
Understand what I'm speakin' on
If time is money I need a loan
But regardless I'll always keep keepin' on
Fuck fake friends!
We don't take L's, we just make M's
While y'all follow, we just make trends
I'm right back to work when that break ends, yeah


Ooh, it's just me, myself and I
Solo ride until I die
'Cause I got me for life (Got me for life, yeah)
Ooh, I don't need a hand to hold
Even when the night is cold
I got that fire in my soul

I don't need anything (Yeah) to get me through the night
Except the beat that's in my heart
Yeah, it's keepin' me alive (Keeps me alive)
I don't need anything to make me satisfied (You know)
'Cause the music does me good
And it gets me every time (Every time)

Yeah, and I don't like talkin' to strangers
So get the fuck off me, I'm anxious
I'm tryna be cool, but I may just go apeshit
Say "Fuck y'all!" to all of y'all faces
It changes though now that I'm famous
Everyone knows how this lifestyle is dangerous
But I love it, the rush is amazin'
Celebrate nightly and everyone rages
I found how to cope with my angers
I'm swimmin' in money
Swimmin' in liquor, my liver is muddy
But it's all good, I'm still sippin' this bubbly
This shit is lovely, this shit ain't random, I didn't get lucky
Made it right here ‘cause I'm sick with it, cuddy
They all take the money for granted
But don't want to work for it — tell me now, isn't it funny? (Nah)


Ooh, it's just me, myself and I
Solo ride until I die
‘Cause I got me for life (Got me for life, yeah)
Ooh, I don't need a hand to hold

'Cause the music does me good

Yeah, lonely nights I laid awake
Pray to Lord my soul to take
My heart's become too cold to break
Know I'm great, but I'm broke as hell
Havin' dreams that I'm foldin' cake
All my life I've been told to wait
But I'ma get it now, yeah, it's no debate
Yeah

Ooh, it's just me, myself and I
Solo ride until I die
'Cause I got me for life (Got me for life, yeah)
Ooh, I don't need a hand to hold

I'm not alone
It's just me and your ghost
And this cripplin' depression
I thought I learned my lesson
But I threw out my phone
And I burned all your clothes
And now I'm not alone
It's just me and your ghost


I got four red bottoms up in flames at my place now (Place now)
I burned three Chanel dresses, three words we don't say now (Say now)
And it's hard not to drink when it's the one thing I think about
It's a lot of spiders in the attic, I don't mean to be dramatic
But I think it's kinda tragic who we magically became now


I'm not alone

I want you to know
I'm a mirrorball
I'll show you every version of yourself tonight
I'll get you out on the floor
Shimmering beautiful
And when I break, it's in a million pieces


Hush, when no one is around, my dear
You'll find me on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you
Hush, I know they said the end is near
But I'm still on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you


I want you to know
I'm a mirrorball
I can change everything about me to fit in
You are not like the regulars
The masquerade revelers
Drunk as they watch my shattered edges glisten

But I'm still on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you


And they called off the circus, burned the disco down
When they sent home the horses and the rodeo clowns
I'm still on that tightrope
I'm still trying everything to get you laughing at me
And I'm still a believer, but I don't know why
I've never been a natural, all I do is try, try, try
I'm still on that trapeze
I'm still trying everything to keep you looking at me


Because I'm a mirrorball
I'm a mirrorball
And I'll show you every version of yourself tonight64Embed

I want you to know
I'm a mirrorball
I'll show you every version of yourself tonight
I'll get you out on the floor
Shimmering beautiful
And when I break, it's in a million pieces


Hush, when no one is around, my dear
You'll find me on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you
Hush, I know they said the end is near
But I'm still on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you


I want you to know
I'm a mirrorball
I can change everything about me to fit in
You are not like the regulars
The masquerade revelers
Drunk as they watch my shattered edges glisten


Hush, when no one is around, my dear
You'll find me on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you
Hush, I know they said the end is near
But I'm still on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you


And they called off the circus, burned the disco down
When they sent home the horses and the rodeo clowns
I'm still on that tightrope
I'm still trying everything to get you laughing at me
And I'm still a believer, but I don't know why
I've never been a natural, all I do is try, try, try
I'm still on that trapeze
I'm still trying everything to keep you looking at me


Because I'm a mirrorball
I'm a mirrorball
And I'll show you every version of yourself tonight","['self-love', 'adventure', 'empowerment']"

You know I adore you, I'm crazier for you
Than I was at sixteen, lost in a film scene
Waving homecoming queens, marching band playing
I'm lost in the lights
American glory faded before me
Now I'm feeling hopeless, ripped up my prom dress
Running through rose thorns, I saw the scoreboard
And ran for my life (Ah)


No cameras catch my pageant smile
I counted days, I counted miles
To see you there, to see you there
It's been a long time coming, but


It's you and me, that's my whole world
They whisper in the hallway, "She's a bad, bad girl" (Okay)
The whole school is rolling fake dice
You play stupid games, you win stupid prizes
It's you and me, there's nothing like this
Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince (Okay)
We're so sad, we paint the town blue
Voted most likely to run away with you
You might also like
My team is losing, battered and bruising
I see the high fives between the bad guys
Leave with my head hung, you are the only one
Who seems to care
American stories burning before me
I'm feeling helpless, the damsels are depressed
Boys will be boys then, where are the wise men?
Darling, I'm scared (Ah)


No cameras catch my muffled cries
I counted days, I counted miles
To see you there, to see you there
And now the storm is coming, but


It's you and me, that's my whole world
They whisper in the hallway, "She's a bad, bad girl" (Okay)
The whole school is rolling fake dice
You play stupid games, you win stupid prizes
It's you and me, there's nothing like this
Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince (Okay)
We're so sad, we paint the town blue
Voted most likely to run away with you

And I don't want you to (Go), I don't really wanna (Fight)
'Cause nobody's gonna (Win), I think you should come home
And I don't want you to (Go), I don't really wanna (Fight)
'Cause nobody's gonna (Win), I think you should come home
And I don't want you to (Go), I don't really wanna (Fight)
'Cause nobody's gonna (Win), just thought you should know
And I'll never let you (Go) 'cause I know this is a (Fight)
That someday we're gonna (Win)

Du stellst mich auf ein Podest und sagst mir, ich bin der Beste
Hebst mich hoch in den Himmel, bis die Luft dünn wird (Yeah)
Füllst mich auf mit Selbstvertrauen, ich sag', was in meiner Brust ist
Verschüttest meine Worte und reißt mich nieder, bis nichts mehr übrig ist
Ordnest die Stücke neu an, damit sie zu mir passen, yeah


Aber was wenn ich, wenn ich stolpere?
Was wenn ich, wenn ich falle?
Bin ich dann das Monster?
Lass es mich einfach wissen
Und was wenn ich, wenn ich sündige?
Und was wenn ich, wenn ich zusammenbreche? Yeah
Bin ich dann das Monster? Yeah
Lass es mich einfach wissen, yeah


Ich war fünfzehn, als die Welt mich auf ein Podest stellte
Ich hatte große Träume, Shows zu spielen und Erinnerungen zu schaffen
Brachte einige schlechte Aktionen, um cool zu wirken, verärgert über ihren Neid, uh
Sie hoben mich hoch (Hoben mich hoch), hoben mich hoch (Yeah)
Und rissen mich nieder (Nieder), rissen mich nieder (Nieder, nieder)
Ich werde die Verantwortung übernehmen, für alles, was ich tat (Yeah)
Verübelst es mir (Yeah), als wärst du der Heilige (Yeah)

Romantic talkin'? You don't even have to try
You're cute enough to fuck with me tonight
Lookin' at the table, all I see is weed and white
Baby, you livin' the life, but nigga, you ain't livin' right


Cocaine and drinkin' with your friends
You live in the dark, boy, I cannot pretend
I'm not fazed, only here to sin
If Eve ain't in your garden, you know that you can


Call me when you want, call me when you need

What's up everybody it's 24kGoldn, I'm really proud of this.. I spent hours and hours designing the world.. Picking the songs, re-recording new vocals.. Rehearsing all the moves and dressed like i'm about to go deep in the metaverse just for y'all... See you soon, I gotta get on stage

You see this? This is called a relic. I've hidden five of them across the entire concert.. And if you can collect them all you're gonna get a special reward.. Now, because I'm a nice guy.. The first one is a freebie. Thank me later for that. Uh, this first song we're going to get into is one of my favorites, it's a very special song to me..

Just say when, I'd play again
He was my best friend down at the sandlot
I felt more when we played pretend
Than with all the Kens
'Cause he took me out of my box
Stole my tortured heart
Left all these broken parts
Told me I'm better off
But I'm not

Shinin' down on me
Moon, tell me if I could
Send up my heart to you?
So when I die, which I must do
Could it shine down here with you?


'Cause my love is mine, all mine
I love, my, my, mine
Nothing in the world belongs to me

Showed me what my heart was worth

We gather here, we line up, weepin' in a sunlit room

Even on my worst day, did I deserve, babe
All the hell you gave me?
'Cause I loved you, I swear I loved you
'Til my dying day


I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
And you're the hero flying around, saving face
And if I'm dead to you, why are you at the wake?
Cursing my name, wishing I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet


We gather stones, never knowing what they'll mean
Some to throw, some to make a diamond ring
You know I didn't want to have to haunt you
But what a ghostly scene
You wear the same jewels that I gave you
As you bury me


I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
'Cause when I'd fight, you used to tell me I was brave
And if I'm dead to you, why are you at the wake?
Cursing my name, wishing I stayed

And you can aim for my heart, go for blood
But you would still miss me in your bones
And I still talk to you (When I'm screaming at the sky)
And when you can't sleep at night (You hear my stolen lullabies)


I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
And so the battleships will sink beneath the waves
You had to kill me, but it killed you just the same
Cursing my name, wishing I stayed
You turned into your worst fears
And you're tossing out blame, drunk on this pain
Crossing out the good years

Your little hand's wrapped around my finger
And it's so quiet in the world tonight
Your little eyelids flutter 'cause you're dreaming
So I tuck you in, turn on your favorite nightlight


To you, everything's funny
You got nothing to regret
I'd give all I have, honey
If you could stay like that


Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
I won't let nobody hurt you
Won't let no one break your heart
And no one will desert you
Just try to never grow up


And never grow up


You're in the car, on the way to the movies
And you're mortified your mom's droppin' you off
At fourteen, there's just so much you can't do
And you can't wait to move out someday and call your own shots
You might also like
But don't make her drop you off around the block
Remember that she's gettin' older, too
And don't lose the way that you dance around
In your PJs getting ready for school


Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
And no one's ever burned you
Nothing's ever left you scarred
And even though you want to
Just try to never grow up


Take pictures in your mind of your childhood room
Memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home
Remember the footsteps, remember the words said
And all your little brother's favorite songs
I just realized everything I have is, someday, gonna be gone


So, here I am in my new apartment
In a big city, they just dropped me off
It's so much colder than I thought it would be
So I tuck myself in and turn my nightlight on

Wish I'd never grown up
Wish I'd never grown up
Oh, I don't wanna grow up
Wish I'd never grown up, I could still be little
Oh, I don't wanna grow up
Wish I'd never grown up, it could still be simple
Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
I won't let nobody hurt you (Never grow up)

We're all here, the lights and noise are blinding
We hang back, it's all in the timing

Aqui vou eu
Quebrando, quebrando, quero romper essas paredes
Quebrando, quebrando, quero ecoar por todos os cantos
Chegando, cara nova, um novo dia
Uh, Lalisa, Rosalía


Absorvendo
Tudo novo
Então eu corto
Vou direto à raiz
Pronta para florescer, yeah


Do roxo ao dourado
A dor foi e voltou de novo
Caminhei pelo fogo
E me redescobri


Acerta quando eu chego, garota, é melhor sair da frente
Acelerando minha a-au-au-au-aura
Foco na minha mente, aproveitando meu tempo
Eu sou uma nova mulher, mulher
Garota, é melhor sair da frеnte
Acelerando minha a-au-au-au-aura

There's glitter on the floor after the party

Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor

But I stay when you're lost and I’m scared and you're turnin' away
I want your midnights
But I'll be cleanin' up bottles with you on New Year's Day


You squeeze my hand three times in the back of the taxi
I can tell that it's gonna be a long road
I'll be there if you’re the toast of the town, babe
Or if you strike out and you’re crawlin' home


Don’t read the last page
But I stay when it's hard or it's wrong or we're makin’ mistakes

Whispered something in your ear
It was a perverted thing to say
But I said it anyway
Made you smile and look away


Nothing's gonna hurt you, baby
As long as you're with me, you'll be just fine
Nothing's gonna hurt you, baby
Nothing's gonna take you from my side


When we dance in my living room
To that silly 90's R&B
When we have a drink or three
Always ends in a hazy shower scene


Nothing's gonna hurt you, baby
As long as you're with me, you'll be just fine

Nothing's gonna take you from my side

Ayy, Mustard on the beat, ho
Deebo any rap nigga, he a free throw
Man down, call an amberlamps, tell him, "Breathe, bro"
Nail a nigga to the cross, he walk around like Teezo
What's up with these jabroni-ass niggas tryna see Compton?
The industry can hate me, fuck 'em all and they mama
How many opps you really got? I mean, it's too many options
I'm finna pass on this body, I'm John Stockton
Beat your ass and hide the Bible if God watchin'
Sometimes you gotta pop out and show niggas
Certified boogeyman, I'm the one that up the score with 'em
Walk him down, whole time, I know he got some ho in him
Pole on him, extort shit, bully Death Row on him
Say, Drake, I hear you like 'em young
You better not ever go to cell block one
To any bitch that talk to him and they in love
Just make sure you hide your lil' sister from him
They tell me Chubbs the only one that get your hand-me-downs
And Party at the party playin' with his nose now
And Baka got a weird case, why is he around?
Certified Lover Boy? Certified pedophiles
Wop, wop, wop, wop, wop, Dot, fuck 'em up
Wop, wop, wop, wop, wop, I'ma do my stuff

Rabbit hole is still deep, I can go further, I promise

Homie still doubled down callin' us some slaves
Atlanta was the Mecca, buildin' railroads and trains
Bear with me for a second, let me put y'all on game
The settlers was usin' townfolk to make 'em richer
Fast-forward, 2024, you got the same agenda
You run to Atlanta when you need a check balance
Let me break it down for you, this the real nigga challenge
You called Future when you didn't see the club (Ayy, what?)
Lil Baby helped you get your lingo up (What?)
21 gave you false street cred
Thug made you feel like you a slime in your head (Ayy, what?)
Quavo said you can be from Northside (What?)
2 Chainz say you good, but he lied
You run to Atlanta when you need a few dollars
No, you not a colleague, you a fuckin' colonizer

You went to a party
I heard from everybody
You part the crowd like the Red Sea
Don't even get me started
Did you get anxious though
On the way home?
I guess I'll never, ever know
Now that we don't talk


You grew your hair long
You got new icons
And from the outside
It looks like you're tryin' lives on
I miss the old ways
You didn't have to change
But I guess I don't have a say
Now that we don't talk


I call my mom, she said that it was for the best
Remind myself, the morе I gave, you'd want me less
I cannot bе your friend, so I pay the price of what I lost
And what it cost, now that we don't talk

What do you tell your friends we
Shared dinners, long weekends with?

I call my mom, she said to get it off my chest (Off my chest)
Remind myself the way you faded 'til I left ('Til I left)
I cannot be your friend, so I pay the price of what I lost (Of what I lost)
And what it cost, now that we don't talk


I don't have to pretend I like acid rock
Or that I'd like to be on a mega yacht
With important men who think important thoughts
Guess maybe I am better off now that we don't talk
And the only way back to my dignity
Was to turn into a shrouded mystery
Just like I had been when you were chasing me
Guess this is how it has to be now that we don't talk9Embed

Like you have empathy inside but you don't really care

I used to shut my door while my mother screamed in the kitchen

The older I get, the more that I see
My parents aren't heroes, they're just like me
And loving is hard, it don't always work
You just try your best not to get hurt
I used to be mad, but now I know
Sometimes it's better to let someone go
It just hadn't hit me yet
The older I get

Oh, oh-oh

Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more (Kio, Kio)

I got the horses in the back
Horse tack is attached
Hat is matte black
Got the boots that's black to match
Ridin' on a horse, ha
You can whip your Porsche

You ain't been up off that porch, now


Can't nobody tell me nothin'

Cowboy hat from Gucci
Wrangler on my booty

Spent a lot of money on my brand new guitar
Baby's got a habit: diamond rings and Fendi sports bras
Ridin' down Rodeo in my Maserati sports car
Got no stress, I've been through all that

Wish I could roll on back to that old town road

Oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

It's a little blurry how the whole thing started
I don't even really know what you intended
Thought that you were cute and you could make me jealous
Poured it down, so I poured it down
Next thing that I know, I'm in a hotel with you
You were talkin' deep like it was mad love to you
You wanted my heart, but I just liked your tattoos
Poured it down, so I poured it down


And now I don't understand it
You don't mess with love, you mess with the truth
And I know I shouldn't say it
But my heart don't understand


Why I got you on my mind

I don't even really know what you intended
Thought that you were cute and you could make me jealous
Poured it down, so I poured it down

You were talkin' deep like it was mad love to you
You wanted my heart, but I just liked your tattoos
Poured it down, so I poured it down

Built an opera house for you in the deepest jungle
And I walked across its stage, singing with my eyes closed
I've got a love for you I just can't escape
All of my love for you cuts me like barbed wire


Ooh, I was meant to love you
And always keep you in my life
Ooh, I was meant to love you
I knew I loved you at first sight


If I abandoned love, I'd be a man without dreams (ooh)
I'd rather be out there staring death right between its eyes now
And I can still hear the sound of you crying through the night
There in the opera house with no one else for miles

Looking at it now
Last December (Last December)
We were built to fall apart
And fall back together (Back together)
Ooh, your necklace hanging from my neck
The night we couldn't quite forget
When we decided, we decided
To move the furniture so we could dance
Baby, like we stood a chance

Trust me, I have magical foresight
You gon’ see me sleepin' in courtside
You gon' see me eatin' ten more times
Ugh, you can’t take that bitch nowhere

We were stayin' in Paris
To get away from your parents
And I thought, "Wow
If I could take this in a shot right now
I don't think that we could work this out"
Out on the terrace
I don't know if it's fair, but I thought, "How
Could I let you fall by yourself
While I'm wasted with someone else?"


If we go down, then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever
If we go down, then we go down together
We'll get away with everything
Let's show them we are better

We were stayin' in Paris
To get away from your parents
You look so proud
Standing there with a frown and a cigarette

It's even harder to picture

You say it's too late to make it

And in our time that you wasted

Still stuck in that time
When we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise

I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone, baby it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?
If "Happy Ever Afters" did exist
I would still be holding you like this
All those fairy tales are full of shit
One more stupid love song, I'll be sick
Now I'm at a payphone


Man, fuck that shit
I'll be out spending all this money
While you're sitting round wondering
Why it wasn't you who came up from nothing
Made it from the bottom
Now when you see me I'm stunting
And all of my cars start with a push of a button

Telling me the chances I blew up
Or whatever you call it
Switch the number to my phone
So you never could call it
Don't need my name on my show
You can tell it I'm ballin

Swish, what a shame could have got picked
Had a really good game but you missed your last shot
So you talk about who you see at the top
Or what you could have saw but sad to say it's over for
Phantom pulled up valet open doors
Wiz like go away, got what you was looking for
Now it's me who they want, so you can go and take
That little piece of shit with you
I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you

I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone, baby it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?

Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember
The people we used to be...
It's even harder to picture
That you're not here next to me

You say it's too late to make it
But is it too late to try?
And in our time that you wasted
All of our bridges burned down

I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time
When we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise

I'm at a payphone trying to call home

If "Happy Ever Afters" did exist
I would still be holding you like this
All those fairy tales are full of shit
One more stupid love song, I'll be sick

Oh, you turned your back on tomorrow
'Cause you forgot yesterday
I gave you my love to borrow
But you just gave it away

You can't expect me to be fine
I don't expect you to care
I know I've said it before
But all of our bridges burned down

I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed

I walk all alone through the streets
Looking carefully at the monuments
The classic foreigner with a strange look
Who walks around tiredly all over the city
At a certain point of the walk
A boy calls me from one side
At first glance he seemed so respectable
He offers to act as a guide around the city

Forgive me, Peter
My lost fearless leader
In closets like cedar
Preserved from when we were just kids
Is it somethin' I did?
The goddess of timing
Once found us beguiling
She said she was trying
Peter, was she lying?
My ribs get the feeling she did


And I didn't wanna come down
I thought it was just goodbye for now


You said you were gonna grow up
Then you were gonna come find me
Said you were gonna grow up
Thеn you were gonna come find mе
Said you were gonna grow up
Then you were gonna come find me
Words from the mouths of babes
Promises oceans-deep
But never to keep
Oh, never to keep
You might also like
Are you still a mind reader?
A natural scene-stealer?
I've heard great things, Peter
But life was always easier on you
Than it was on me
And sometimes it gets me
When crossing your jet stream
We both did the best we could do
Underneath the same moon
In different galaxies


And I didn't wanna hang around
We said it was just goodbye for now


You said you were gonna grow up
Then you were gonna come find me
Said you were gonna grow up
Then you were gonna come find me
Said you were gonna grow up
Then you were gonna come find me
Words from the mouths of babes
Promises oceans-deep
But never to keep
Never to keep

And I won't confess that I waited, but I let the lamp burn
As the men masqueraded, I hoped you'd return
With your feet on the ground, tell me all that you'd learned
'Cause love's never lost when perspective is earned
And you said you'd come and get me, but you were twenty-five
And the shelf life of those fantasies has expired
Lost to the "Lost Boys" chapter of your life
Forgive me, Peter, please know that I tried
To hold on (Hold on) to the days (To the days)
When you were mine
But the woman who sits by the window
Has turned out the light


You said you were gonna grow up
Then you were gonna come find me
Said you were gonna grow up
You said you were gonna grow up
Then you were gonna come find me
Said you were gonna grow up
You said you were gonna grow up
Then you were gonna come find me
Said you were gonna grow up

फिर से उड़ चला
उड़ के छोड़ा है जहां नीचे
मैं तुम्हारे अब हूँ हवाले


अब दूर-दूर लोग बाग़, मीलों दूर ये वादियाँ
फिर धुंआ-धुंआ तन हर बदली चली आती है छूने
पर कोई बदली कभी कहीं कर दे तन गीला ये है भी ना हो

किसी मंज़र पर मैं रुका नहीं
कभी खुद से भी मैं मिला नहीं
ये गिला तो है, मैं खफ़ा नहीं

शहर एक से, गाँव एक से
लोग एक से, नाम एक


फिर से उड़ चला


मिट्टी जैसे सपने ये कित्ता भी पलकों से झाड़ो फिर आ जाते हैं
इतने सारे सपने क्या कहूँ किस तरह से मैंने तोड़े हैं, छोड़े हैं, क्यूँ?
फिर साथ चले, मुझे ले के उड़े ये क्यूँ?


कभी डाल-डाल, कभी पात-पात
मेरे साथ-साथ फिरे दर-दर ये
कभी सेहरा, कभी सावन, बनूँ रावण क्यूँ मर मर के?
कभी डाल-डाल, कभी पात-पात
कभी दिन है रात कभी दिन-दिन है

Lovin' can hurt
Lovin' can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
And when it gets hard
You know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive

We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closin'
Hearts are never broken
And time's forever frozen still


So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holdin' me closer till our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
Wait for me to come home


Lovin' can heal
Lovin' can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know, know
I swear it will get easier
Remember that with every piece of ya

It's nine o'clock on a Saturday
The regular crowd shuffles in
There's an old man sittin' next to me
Makin' love to his tonic and gin
He says, "Son, can you play me a memory?
I'm not really sure how it goes
But it's sad, and it's sweet, and I knew it complete
When I wore a younger man's clothes"


La, la-la, di-dee-da
La-la, di-dee-da da-dum


Sing us a song, you're the piano man
Sing us a song tonight
Well, we're all in the mood for a melody
And you've got us feelin' alright


Now John at the bar is a friend of mine
He gets me my drinks for free
And he's quick with a joke, or to light up your smoke
But there's someplace that he'd rather be
He says, "Bill, I believe this is killing me"
As the smile ran away from his face
"Well, I'm sure that I could be a movie star
If I could get out of this place"

And he's talkin' with Davy, who's still in the navy

But it's better than drinkin' alone

Don't prove I'm right
And please, pleasе, please
Don't bring me to tеars when I just did my makeup so nice
Heartbreak is one thing, my ego's another
I beg you, don't embarrass me, motherfucker, oh
Please, please, please (Ah)


Well, I have a fun idea, babe (Uh-huh), maybe just stay inside
I know you're cravin' some fresh air, but the ceiling fan is so nice (It's so nice, right?)
And we could live so happily if no one knows that you're with me
I'm just kidding, but really (Kinda), really, really


Please, please, please (Please don't prove I'm right)
Don't prove I'm right
And please, please, please
Don't bring me to tears when I just did my makeup so nice
Heartbreak is one thing (Heartbreak is one thing), my ego's another (Ego's another)
I beg you, don't embarrass me, motherfucker, oh
Please, please, please (Ah)


If you wanna go and be stupid
Don't do it in front of me
If you don't wanna cry to my music
Don't make me hate you prolifically
Please, please, please (Please)
Please, please, please (Please)
Please (Please), please (Please), please
(Ah)","['sadness', 'empowerment', 'energy']"

"Go ahead," when I'm walking
Face the lie that I'm hawking
"No, don't wanna, won't happen"


Pope is a rockstar
You take your clothes off
Heading for the last fight
Before our worlds part


We can wait forever for the world to untrack
We can wait forever for the worthwhile track
And, oh, you want to start talking
Fall together, I'm walking
Face the lie that I'm hawking
We can always fight


You can be the highlight

Hoping on a late night


How you wanna start talking?
How you wanna start walking?
We can make a landslide, dive-in
We can let it all go, cave-in

JD на треке
Iceberg хочет сумку с деньгами, сука


Мы подкатили на твою тусовку, я с бандой
И это будет ограбление, так что возьмем твою цепь
Я убийца, девка, прости, но я не могу измениться
Мы не целимся в твое тело, выстрелы попадают в твой мозг
Мы пришли из нищеты, парень, у нас нет ничего
Так много вражды, но никто не говорит мое имя
Эти убийцы в дружбе со мной, маленький ниггер, не получи пиздюлей
Потому что они сделают ту работу за меня, пока я буду запрыгивать в самолет


Она не любит свое тело, покинула доктора с новой фигурой
Названивает на мой телефон, потому что она просто видит меня с моей новой малышкой
Сердцеед, леди меня любят, будто я Cool J
Она пыталась прилипнуть к ниггеру, но уже очень поздно
Забронировал полет в Калифорнию, тысячи и презервативы в моей сумке
И каждый доллар в этих стопках тысяч имеет синее лицо
Бриллианты на Rollie, они в качестве HD, будто это Blu-Ray
Как я ебашу, я должен быть на обложке 2K
Провожаю лето, я возможно подкачу в новом Wraith
Диссишь банду, из-за этого будет преследоваться лишь твоя команда
И мы распродаем дерьмо, лучше бы тебе затянуть шнурки
Маленький бро, подойди по ближе, пусть Глок 22 расстреляет тебя

Я звоню маленькому бро, он сказал, что готов к ограблению
Кого ты представляешь? Ты позорник, ты никогда не чувствовал боль
Клянусь, вокруг меня убийцы, которые сделают сумасшедшие вещи за банду
Если я покажу тебе все свои обвинения, ты не посмотришь на меня больше также
Делал выборы в моей жизни, которые я хотел бы не делать
Потерял моего брата, видел его смерть и я просто видел его выпуск из школы
Имею пушку с калибром .40 при мне and I'm just rollin' patty cakes
Обе мои руки могут сделать работу, и я говорю не про мастурбацию
Я был и в штате и за его пределами, потому что нужно было зарабатывать деньги
Я рисковал жизнью, но все хорошо, потому что Бог не даст мне умереть
Нахуй завтра, шныряем по твоему блоку, просто знай, мы вернемся сегодня
Я звоню Polo, он приходит один, мы убиваем вас быстрым путем


Мы подкатали на твою тусовку, я с бандой
И это будет ограбление, так что возьмем твою цепь

Three little birds sat on my window
And they told me I don't need to worry
Summer came like cinnamon, so sweet
Little girls double-dutch on the concrete


Maybe sometimes we got it wrong, but it's all right
The more things seem to change, the more they stay the same
Don't you hesitate


Girl, put your records on, tell me your favorite song
You go ahead, let your hair down
Sapphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams
Just go ahead, let your hair down


You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow


Blue as the sky, sunburnt and lonely
Sipping tea in the bar by the roadside (Just relax, just relax)
Don't you let those other boys fool you

साहिलों पे आया है, तू जाने किस तरह हाँ लेके
कुछ तोह है तुझसे राब्ता
कुछ तोह है तुझसे राब्ता
कैसे हम जाने हमे क्या पता
कुछ तोह है तुझसे राब्ता

Knew he was a killer first time that I saw him
Wondered how many girls he had loved and left haunted
But if he's a ghost, then I can be a phantom
Holdin' him for ransom, some
Some boys are tryin' too hard, he don't try at all, though
Younger than my exes, but he act like such a man, so
I see nothin' better, I keep him forever
Like a vendetta-ta


I, I, I see how this is gon' go
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know


In the middle of the night, in my dreams
You should see the things we do, baby, mmm
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
I know I'm gonna be with you, so I take my time
Are you ready for it?


Knew I was a robber first time that he saw me
Stealin' hearts and runnin' off and never sayin' sorry
But if I'm a thief, then he can join the heist and
We'll move to an island and
And he can be my jailer, Burton to this Taylor
Every love I've known in comparison is a failure
I forget their names now, I'm so very tame now
Never be the same now, now

Knew he was a killer first time that I saw him
Wondered how many girls he had loved and left haunted
But if he's a ghost, then I can be a phantom
Holdin' him for ransom, some
Some boys are tryin' too hard, he don't try at all, though
Younger than my exes, but he act like such a man, so
I see nothin' better, I keep him forever
Like a vendetta-ta

Knew I was a robber first time that he saw me
Stealin' hearts and runnin' off and never sayin' sorry
But if I'm a thief, then he can join the heist and
We'll move to an island and
And he can be my jailer, Burton to this Taylor
Every love I've known in comparison is a failure
I forget their names now, I'm so very tame now
Never be the same now, now

Maybe this is karma, definition of jaded, oh

Tryna put a muzzle on my crazy feelings
One minute I'm cool and then the next, I’m trippin', no

Wasted on my mind, she's still on my mind

रेत पे पैरों से तेरे निशान मेरे दिल पर
लोगो की लहरों सी, हाए
बातों से मिटेंगे कब तक
हो जाना तू रिहा, मेरे
हो जाना तू रिहा, मेरे
न होना चाहूँ मैं
न हो सकूँ कभी


तस्वीरों में मुस्कुराहट थी
अब मेरे चेहरे पे है क्यों नहीं, यह पूछते
इन ग़ैरों को है समझ नहीं कोई
तस्वीरों में तुम भी खड़ी थी
मिश्री सी यह यादें संभली पड़ी
तुम बिन में मेरे हो
तू है नूर सा, नूर ही है अलग
तू ऐसे मेरा है जान
लए से आ जा मेरे
मेरी निंदियों में तुम ऐसे ओ
बंद पलकों तले
तुम हर एक पल मेरे पास हो


तू है नहीं, तू है मगर
तू है नहीं, मैं कौन हूँ
तू है परिन्दों-सा यूँ उड़ चला
बिन तेरे बता मैं कौन हूँ

रातों में तारों से यूँ टूट कर मेरे
तू लौट आना
रह जाना तू यहाँ मेरे
रह जाना तू यहाँ मेरे
जब तक मिलूँ नहीं

रेत पे पैरों से तेरे निशान मेरे दिल पर
लोगो की लहरों सी, हाए
बातों से मिटेंगे कब तक
हो जाना तू रिहा, मेरे
हो जाना तू रिहा, मेरे
न होना चाहूँ मैं
न हो सकूँ कभी


तस्वीरों में मुस्कुराहट थी
अब मेरे चेहरे पे है क्यों नहीं, यह पूछते
इन ग़ैरों को है समझ नहीं कोई
तस्वीरों में तुम भी खड़ी थी
मिश्री सी यह यादें संभली पड़ी
तुम बिन में मेरे हो
तू है नूर सा, नूर ही है अलग
तू ऐसे मेरा है जान
लए से आ जा मेरे
मेरी निंदियों में तुम ऐसे ओ
बंद पलकों तले
तुम हर एक पल मेरे पास हो


तू है नहीं, तू है मगर
तू है नहीं, मैं कौन हूँ
तू है परिन्दों-सा यूँ उड़ चला
बिन तेरे बता मैं कौन हूँ


नींदों में गुलिस्तान है
तेरा-मेरा ही है ये आशियाना
रातों में तारों से यूँ टूट कर मेरे
तू लौट आना
रह जाना तू यहाँ मेरे
रह जाना तू यहाँ मेरे
जब तक मिलूँ नहीं

Long may you reign

Out window panes talking utter nonsense
You have no idea


Strings tied to levers
Slowed-down clocks tethered
All this showmanship
To keep it for you in sweetness


Way to go, tiger
Higher and higher
Wilder and lighter

Long may you roar
At your dinosaurs
You're a just ruler
Covered in mud, you look ridiculous
And you have no idea


Buried down deep
And out of your reach

She likes fighting with the gloves off

I saw you cry, I just wanna die

And she hit me up like every day, she know what it is

I've never seen a diamond in the flesh
I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies
And I'm not proud of my address
In a torn-up town, no postcode envy


But every song's like
Gold teeth, Grey Goose, trippin' in the bathroom
Bloodstains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room
We don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams
But everybody's like
Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
We don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair


And we'll never be royals (Royals)
It don't run in our blood
That kind of luxe just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler (Ruler)
You can call me queen bee
And baby, I'll rule (I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule)
Let me live that fantasy
You might also like
My friends and I, we've cracked the code
We count our dollars on the train to the party
And everyone who knows us knows
That we're fine with this, we didn't come from money


But every song's like

And I'm in love with being queen
(Oh, oh-oh)
Life is great without a care
We aren't caught up in your love affair

I saw her in the rightest way
Looking like Anne Hathaway
Laughing while she hit her pen and coughed, and coughed
And then she came up to my knees
Begging, "Baby, would you please
Do the things you said you'd do to me, to me?"


Oh, won't you kiss me on the mouth and love me like a sailor?
And when you get a taste, can you tell me, what's my flavor?
I don't believe in God, but I believe that you're my savior
My mom says that she's worried, but I'm covered in this favor
And when we're getting dirty, I forget all that is wrong
I sleep so I can see you 'cause I hate to wait so long
I sleep so I can see you, and I hate to wait so long


She took my fingers to her mouth
The kind of thing that makes you proud
That nothing else had ever worked out, worked out
And lately, I tried other things
But nothing can capture the sting
Of the venom she's gonna spit out right now


Oh, won't you kiss me on the mouth and love me like a sailor?
And when you get a taste, can you tell me, what's my flavor?
I don't believe in God, but I believe that you're my savior
I know that you've been worried, but you're dripping in my favor
And when we're getting dirty, I forget all that is wrong
I sleep so I can see you 'cause I hate to wait so long

Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year


Feeling Christmas all around
And I'm trying to play it cool
But it's hard to focus when I see him walking 'cross the room
"Let It Snow" is blasting out
But I won't get in the mood
I'm avoiding every mistletoe until I know it's


True love that he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone, boy


Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year


I've been down this road before
Fell in love on Christmas night
But on New Year's Day, I woke up and he wasn't by my side
Now I need someone to hold
Be my fire in the cold

Ooh (Ooh, ooh)
Life's better on Saturn
Got to break this pattern
Of floating away
Ooh (Ooh, ooh)
Find something worth saving
It's all for the taking

I'll be better on Saturn
None of this matters
Dreaming of Saturn, oh


If karma's really real
How am I still here?
Just seems so unfair
I could be wrong though
If there's a point to being good
Then where's my reward?
The good die young and poor
I gave it all I could


Stuck in this terradome (Ooh)
All I see is terrible (Ooh)
Making us hysterical (Ooh)
There's got to be more, got to be more
Sick of this head of mine (Ooh)
Intrusive thoughts, they paralyze (Ooh)
Nirvana's not as advertised (Ooh)

When we're all born, Saturn's somewhere
And the Saturn cycle takes around about twenty-nine years
That's when we gotta wake up and smell the coffee
Because if we've just been sort of relying on our cleverness
Or relying—, you know, just kind of floating along
Saturn comes along and hits you over the head
Hits you over the head, hits you over the head, and says, "Wake up"
Aha, it's time for you to get real about life and sort out who you really are

I've known it from the very start
We’re a shot in the darkest dark
Oh no, oh no, I'm unarmed
The waiting is a sadness
Fading into madness
Oh no, oh no, it won't stop


I’m standin' on a tightrope alone
I hold my breath a little bit longer
Halfway out the door, but it won't close
I'm holdin' out hope for you to


Say, "Don't go"
I would stay forever if you say, "Don't go"


Why'd you have to lead me on?
Why’d you have to twist the knife?
Walk away and leave me bleedin’, bleedin'?
Why’d you whisper in the dark
Just to leave me in the night?

Strike a match, then you blow it out

I met you in the dark, you lit me up
You made me feel as though I was enough
We danced the night away, we drank too much
I held your hair back when you were throwin' up


Then, you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute, I was stone-cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, "I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest"


I knew I loved you then, but you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go
I knew I needed you, but I never showed
But I wanna stay with you until we're grey and old


Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go


I'll wake you up with some breakfast in bed
I'll bring you coffee with a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school, wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night

I wanna dance with you right now, woah
And you look as beautiful as ever
And I swear that every day, you'll get better
You make me feel this way somehow


I'm so in love with you and I hope you know
Darlin', your love is more than worth its weight in gold
We've come so far, my dear, look how we've grown
And I wanna stay with you until we're grey and old


Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go


I wanna live with you even when we're ghosts
'Cause you were always there for me when I needed you most


I'm gonna love you till my lungs give out
I promise till death we part, like in our vows
So, I wrote this song for you, now everybody knows
That it's just you and me till we're grey and old

She just wants to be beautiful
She goes unnoticed, she knows no limits
She craves attention, she praises an image
She prays to be sculpted by the sculptor
Oh, she don't see the light that's shinin'
Deeper than the eyes can find it
Maybe we have made her blind
So she tries to cover up her pain
And cut her woes away
'Cause covergirls don't cry
After their face is made
But


There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark

Esa es la única vez que nos besamos, besamos
Existes detrás de mis parpados, mis parpados

Cupido me dio, Cupido me dio con presición, yo
Me pregunto si miras a ambos lados
Cuando mi cruzas mi mente, dije, dije
Estoy harto, harto, harto, harto de perseguirte
Tú eres la persona que siempre está corriendo a través de mis sueños, yo
Yo solo puedo ver tu cara cuando cierro mis ojos


¿Puedo tener un beso?
¿Y puedes hacer que dure para siempre?
Dije que estoy a punto de ir a la guerra
Y no sé si volveré a verte

О боже, она далеко от пригородных городов
Приехала в город за любовью, теперь ей больно
О боже, она далеко от пригородного города
Долгий путь, очень длинный путь от пригорода


Любовь к маленькому городу, влюблённость не лечится вовсе
Слишком много пью, много думаю, мысли от тебе топят меня
Слишком высоко, пожалуйста, не плачь, перестань сомневаться во мне
Ты не знаешь любви, ты просто показываешь любовь, останови меня


Самовлюблённость, он не любит себя, пытается любить меня
Наденьте на меня наручники и скажите ему правду, что он мне не доверяет

Home grown alligator, see you later
Gotta hit the road, gotta hit the road
Something changed in the atmosphere
Architecture unfamiliar

Time flies by in the yellow and green
Stick around and you'll see what I mean
There's a mountain-top that I'm dreamin' of
If you need me you know where I'll be


I'll be ridin' shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feelin' like a someone
I'll be ridin' shotgun underneath the hot sun

Gotta hit the road, gotta hit the road
Deep sea divin' 'round the clock

Flamingo pink, Sunrise Boulevard
Clink, clink, being this young is art
Aquamarine, moonlit swimmin' pool
What if all I need is you?


Got love-struck, went straight to my head
Got lovesick all over my bed
Love to think you’ll never forget
Handprints in wet cement
Adorned with smoke on my clothes
Lovelorn and nobody knows
Love thorns all over this rose
I'll pay the price, you won't


But if I’m all dressed up
They might as well be lookin' at us
And if they call me a slut
You know it might be worth it for once
And if I'm gonna be drunk
I might as well be drunk in love

Send the code, he's waitin' there
The sticks and stones they throw froze mid-air
Everyone wants him, that was my crime
The wrong place at the right time
And I break down, then he's pullin' me in
In a world of boys, he's a gentleman

Half asleep
Takin’ your time in the tangerine
Neon light, this is luxury
You're not sayin' you're in love with me
But you're goin' to
Half awake
Takin' your chance, it's a big mistake

More Lana Del Rey) Lyrics
One night, a few moons ago
I saw flecks of what could've been lights
But it might just have been you
Passing by unbeknownst to me
Life is emotionally abusive
And time can't stop me quite like you did
And my flight was awful, thanks for asking
I'm unglued, thanks to you


And it's like snow at the beach
Weird, but fuckin' beautiful
Flying in a dream
Stars by the pocketful
You wanting me
Tonight feels impossible
But it's comin' down
No sound, it's all around


Like snow on the beach
Like snow on the beach
Like snow on the beach
Like snow, ah, ah
You might also like
This scene feels like what I once saw on a screen
I searched "aurora borealis green"
I've never seen someone lit from within
Blurring out my periphery
My smile is like I won a contest
And to hide that would be so dishonest
And it's fine to fake it 'til you make it
'Til you do, 'til it's true


Now, it's like snow at the beach
Weird, but fuckin' beautiful
Flying in a dream
Stars by the pocketful
You wanting me
Tonight feels impossible
But it's comin' down
No sound, it's all around


Like snow on the beach (Mmm)
Like snow on the beach
Like snow on the beach (Mmm)
Like snow, ah, ah

I (I) can't (Can't) speak, afraid to jinx it
I (I) don't (Don't) even dare to wish it
But your eyes are flying saucers from another planet
Now, I'm all for you like Janet
Can this be a real thing? Can it?


Are we falling like snow at the beach? (Snow at the beach)
Weird, but fuckin' beautiful
Flying in a dream (Flying in a dream)
Stars by the pocketful
You wanting me (You wanting me)
Tonight feels impossible
But it's comin' down
No sound, it's all around

I saw in my mind fairy lights through the mist
I kept calm and carried the weight of the rift
Pulled him in tighter each time he was driftin' away
My spine split from carrying us up the hill
Wet through my clothes, weary bones caught the chill
I stopped tryna make him laugh, stopped tryna drill the safe


Thinkin', "How much sad did you think I had
Did you think I had in me?"
Oh, the tragedy
So long, London

I didn't opt in to be your odd man out
I founded the club she's heard great things about
I left all I knew, you left me at the house by the Heath

Every breath feels like rarest air

So how much sad did you think I had
Did you think I had in me?
How much tragedy?
Just how low did you
Think I'd go 'fore I'd self-implode?
'Fore I'd have to go be free?


You swore that you loved me, but where were the clues?
I died on the altar waitin' for the proof

You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end, always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well, you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad it was over


Now and then, I think of all the times you screwed me over
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
But I don't wanna live that way

I heard that you're settled down
That you found a girl and you're married now
I heard that your dreams came true
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you
Old friend, why are you so shy?
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light


I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over


Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead


You know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised in a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days

Agalarım çok düşüncesiz, 5 yıldızlı otellerde sigara içiyorlar
Finnegan ile kodein karıştırıyorlar
Hatun fitleşti, ama yine zayıflamak istiyor
Elma sirkesi içiyor
Skim giyiyor, çünkü Kim ve onlar gibi olmak istiyor
Uh, tamam, sinsi olduğunu biliyorum, masum davranmayı bırak
Bu para babadan oğla geçmiyor, bu milyonları 1 senede kazandım
Arabam Tokyo Drift'te olabilirdi çünkü aynı hızlı ve öfkeli
Toyota Yaris’ten Urus'a geçtim, onların da şansı vardı ama mahvettiler
Şimdi bu hatun beni rahminin içinde istiyor, neyse, zenginim, hadi yapalım (Neyse)


Şu elmaslara yanlış bak, hayat göz kısıncaya kadar geçer, dik dik bakamazsın
Hatunla iyi günde kötü günde, onun götü çok iyi, yolu yarıladım (hahaha)
Kahverengi ve seksi, fikrimi değiştiremezdim, yolu yarılamıştım
Yüz metre, huh, az önce Sprinter'a dokuz tane hatun attım (Uh)
Yüz tane yutucu, bir SUV’a sığamazlar (Yok)
SOS, birileri beni kurtarsın
Peşimde çok kız var, çok, çok kız var, Peşimde
İki haftada hevesimi alırım (Uh,huh)
Tamam, hadi adresini yolla artık, lütfen


SUV, dışı beyaz, içi kahverengi resmen Michael Jack
Torba tutmaya biraz daha sıra gelsin, paraları sevmiyormuş gibi harcıyorum
Tabancayı Irish Ferry botunda çıkardım, çek tetiği de tap dansı gibi ses çıksın (Bap)
Öyle takılırım ki, sarım yok, hakem bana siyah kart çıkartmak zorunda kaldı
Bizim rap ile yaptığımızı kim yaptı?
Yıllardır müziklerinde sattığı yalanlardan sonra konserinin biletleri bile tükenmedi
Sprinter, van araca iki kız sığmaz
Inter, Milan'da iki adam
Benim kızlardan birinin Diddy ile çıktığını duydum

Onu istiyorum, agam da ortak girmek istiyor
Bu konuda ucuzum, hala kızlara gidip "Selam, Netflix'ini ödünç alabilir miyim" diyorum
Hatun feminist, beni cinsiyetçi sandı
Kelimelerimi çarpıtıyor, galiba disleksik

Daft Punk (Türkçe Çeviri) Lyrics


Seni en kötü ruh haline sokmaya çalışıyorum, ah
P1 arabam senin kilise ayakkabılarından daha temiz, ah
Ona verdiğim bir nokta iki milyon dolar sadece canını yakmak içindi, ah
Tüm sahip olduğum Lamborghini'ler sadece seni kızdırmak için, ah
Bu arabaların hiçbiri kiralık değil, ah
Senin yıllık kazancını bir haftada kazanırım, ah
Birinci sürtüğüm senin liginde değil, ah
İkinci sürtüğüm de senin liginde değil, ah


Ev çok boş, ortaya bir şey lazım
Bu yüzden abanoz ağacından kesilmiş, yirmi bin dolarlık bir masa koydum
Bebeğim o masanın üzerinde kokainleri sıralara ayırıyor
Sonra burnu ile temizliyor, adamım, bebeğimi seviyorum
Hep paran hakkında konuşuyorsun, işitme cihazına ihtiyacın var
Benim hakkımda konuşuyorsun, üzerimde gölge göremiyorum
Tarzımı değiştirip, her şekile girerim
İçkimi yenileyip, her acıyı dindiririm


Şu yaptığınıza bir bakın
Ben lanet olası bir Starboy'um
Şu yaptığınıza bir bakın
Ben lanet olası bir Starboy'um

Roadster SV arabamın içindeyim kenara çekmişim, ah
Ceplerim aşırı dolu ağırlaşıyor, ah
Kralın peşinden geliyorsun, bu senin için çok uzun bir mesafe, ah

O markete gidince savurgan duruyor
Arabamın Star Trek II'deki gibi bir tavanı var
Kızlar bu şarkıyı duyduklarında kendinden geçiyorlar
Hız göstergesindeki 100 beni Tanrı'ya daha da yakınlaştırıyor

Trippin' over myself, aching
Begging you to come help
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needin' stitches


Just like a moth drawn to a flame
Oh, you lured me in, I couldn't sense the pain
Your bitter heart, cold to the touch
Now I'm gonna reap what I sow
I'm left seein' red on my own


Got a feeling that I'm goin' under
But I know that I'll make it out alive
If I quit calling you my lover
And move on


You watch me bleed until I can't breathe, shaking
Falling onto my knees
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needin' stitches
Trippin' over myself, aching
Begging you to come help
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needin' stitches


Needle and the thread, gotta get you outta my head
Needle and the thread, gonna wind up dead
Needle and the thread, gotta get you outta my head
Needle and the thread, gonna wind up dead (Gonna wind up dead)
Needle and the thread, gotta get you outta my head (Gotta get you outta my head)
Needle and the thread, gonna wind up dead (Wind up dead)
Needle and the thread, gotta get you outta my head
Get you outta my head


You watch me bleed until I can't breathe, shaking
Falling onto my knees (Falling onto my knees)
And now that I'm without your kisses (Without you)
I'll be needin' stitches (I'll be needin' stitches)
Trippin' over myself, aching
Begging you to come help (Begging, baby, please)
And now that I'm without your kisses (Without your kisses)
I'll be needin' stitches (And I'll be)


Now that I'm without your kisses
Yeah, I'll be needin' stitches (And I'll be)
And now that I'm without your kisses
Yeah, I'll be needin' stitches","['sadness', 'adventure', 'empowerment']"

I want you by my side
So that I never feel alone again
They've always been so kind
But now they've brought you away from me
I hope they didn't get your mind
Your heart is too strong anyway
We need to fetch back the time
They have stolen from us


And I want you, we can bring it on the floor
You've never danced like this before
We don't talk about it
Dancin' on, doin' the boogie all night long
Stoned in paradise
Shouldn't talk about it
And I want you, we can bring it on the floor
You've never danced like this before
We don't talk about it
Dancin' on, doin' the boogie all night long
Stoned in paradise
Shouldn't talk about it
Shouldn't talk about it


Coldest winter for me
No sun is shinin' anymore
The only thing I feel is pain
Caused by absence of you
Suspense controllin' my mind
I cannot find the way outta here
I want you by my side
So that I never feel alone again

Remember when we first met?
You said, "Light my cigarette"
So I lied to my mum and dad
I jumped the fence and I ran
But we couldn't go very far
'Cause you locked your keys in your car
So you sat and stared at my lips
And I could already feel your kiss


Long nights, daydreams
Sugar and smoke rings, I've been a fool
But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you
Headlights on me
Racing to 60, I've been a fool
Strawberries and cigarettes always taste like
Blue eyes, black jeans
Lighters and candy, I've been a fool
But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you


Remember when you taught me fate?
Said it'd all be worth the wait
Like that night in the back of the cab
When your fingers walked in my hand
Next day, nothin' on my phone
But I can still smell you on my clothes
Always hopin' that things would change
But we went right back to your games

And even if I run away
Give my heart a holiday
Still, strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you
You always leave me wanting more
I can't shake my hunger for
Strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you
Yeah, they always taste like you, you
Long nights, daydreams
With that sugar and smoke rings
Always taste like you

Always taste like you


Headlights on me
(And even if I run away)
Racing to 60, I've been a fool
(Give my heart a holiday)
Still, strawberries and cigarettes always taste like
Blue eyes, black jeans
(You always leave me wanting more)
Lighters and candy, I've been a fool
(I can't shake my hunger for)
Strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you34Embed

Remember when we first met?
You said, "Light my cigarette"
So I lied to my mum and dad
I jumped the fence and I ran
But we couldn't go very far
'Cause you locked your keys in your car
So you sat and stared at my lips
And I could already feel your kiss


Long nights, daydreams
Sugar and smoke rings, I've been a fool
But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you
Headlights on me
Racing to 60, I've been a fool
Strawberries and cigarettes always taste like
Blue eyes, black jeans
Lighters and candy, I've been a fool
But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you


Remember when you taught me fate?
Said it'd all be worth the wait
Like that night in the back of the cab
When your fingers walked in my hand
Next day, nothin' on my phone
But I can still smell you on my clothes
Always hopin' that things would change
But we went right back to your games


Long nights, daydreams
Sugar and smoke rings, I've been a fool
But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you
Headlights on me
Racing to 60, I've been a fool
But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like
Blue eyes, black jeans
Lighters and candy, I've been a fool
But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you


And even if I run away
Give my heart a holiday
Still, strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you
You always leave me wanting more
I can't shake my hunger for
Strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you
Yeah, they always taste like you, you
Long nights, daydreams
With that sugar and smoke rings
Always taste like you


Headlights on me
(And even if I run away)
Racing to 60, I've been a fool
(Give my heart a holiday)
Still, strawberries and cigarettes always taste like

Ain't nobody 'round here on your level
You're so far away
You're pouring your heart out

Yeah


Smoke a little weed, smoke a little weed
I've been feelin' low
Pressure in my head, lay awake in bed
I'm against the ropes
Been tryin' to recover but nothin' I do works
'Cause hidin' under the covers is only makin' it worse
I'm stuck...
Think this is growin' up...
Too much is on my mind, always on my mind
Need a little space
Spend my days alone, can't get off my phone
Nothing goes my way
Miss all of my friends and barely can file my taxes
I'm halfway through my twenties
Like, how the hell did this happen?
I'm stuck...
My life is in a rut...


And I've been hopin' these doors might open
And I'll be running from this place, free
Constant pacing; this time, I'm wasting
I can't control these emotions in me

Girlfriend wanna chill, girlfriend wanna chill
I've been workin' late
I don't got no time, workin' all the time
Too much on my plate
And I don't wanna fail, I'm bringin' myself stress
I can't sit on my sofa, I'm lost and depressed
And stuck...
I can't say that enough...
Anxiety is high, I can't even lie
I'm not doin' great
Dishes in the sink, think I need a drink
They gon' have to wait
Stay inside my room that now's become a prison
I hate these four walls, but only feel safe in 'em
I'm stuck...
But no one gives a fuck...

And when we go crashin' down, we come back every time

Making moments
And I don't think you're looking for a new friend
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ready, been waiting here, can we get out of here?
Wanna get you alone
So if you're into me, I got the energy

And all I am is a man
I want the world in my hands
I hate the beach, but I stand
In California with my toes in the sand
Use the sleeves of my sweater, let's have an adventure
Head in the clouds, but my gravity's centered
Touch my neck and I'll touch yours
You in those little high-waisted shorts, oh


She knows what I think about
And what I think about
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no


'Cause it's too cold for you here and now
So let me hold both your hands in the holes of my sweater


And if I may just take your breath away
I don't mind if there's not much to say
Sometimes the silence guides a mind
To move to a place so far away
The goosebumps start to raise
The minute that my left hand meets your waist
And then I watch your face
Put my finger on your tongue 'cause you love the taste, yeah
These hearts adore
Everyone the other beats hardest for
Inside, this place is warm
Outside, it starts to pour

Knowing that I love you, and running my fingers through your hair

Então, se você quer a verdade


Eu só quero fazer parte da sua sinfonia
Você vai me abraçar forte e não me soltar?

Me desculpe se isso tudo é demais (Oh)

I know you're somewhere out there, somewhere far away
I want you back, I want you back
My neighbors think I'm crazy, but they don't understand
You're all I had, you're all I had


At night when the stars light up my room
I sit by myself


Talkin' to the moon
Tryna get to you
In hopes you're on the other side talkin' to me, too
Or am I a fool who sits alone
Talkin' to the moon?
Oh


I'm feeling like I'm famous, the talk of the town
They say I've gone mad, yeah, I've gone mad
But they don't know what I know, 'cause when the sun goes down
Someone's talkin' back, yeah, they're talkin' back, oh

Lágrimas no clube
Porque seu amor me deixou fudida
Lágrimas no clube (Lágrimas no clube)


Eu quero te tirar dos
Meus quadris, minhas coxas, minha cabeça, meus olhos, meus choros noturnos
Eu quero tirar minha roupa
Quero tocar meus quadris, minhas coxas, minha cabeça, não é seu, é meu, sim
Q-quero te tirar do meu corpo
Tocar você com meus quadris, minhas coxas, meus erros, meus direitos, sim
Ouça o ritmo e não faça concessões
Porque você me machucou


Eu não quero acreditar que eu pertenço a você
Eu me perdi de maneiras que você nunca poderia fazer
Eu te quero mais, eu te quero mais, eu, eu

Quién lo diría que se podría
Hacer el amor por telepatía
La luna está llena, mi cama vacía

You know I'm just a flight away
If you want it, you could take a private plane
A kilómetros estamos conectando
Y me prendes aunque no me estés tocando
You know I got a lot to say
All these voices in the background of my brain
Y me dicen todo lo que estás pensando
Me imagino lo que ya estás maquinando

Should tell my boyfriend what I been doin'

But I can't have my heart lookin' stupid
I gave niggas a shot and they blew it
Initially, I wouldn't do this

We was just friends, but then came in Cupid
The tension was buildin', we had to pursue it

Kyun saans loon, kyun main jiyun
Jeena bura sa lage
Kyun ho gaya tu bewafaa
Mujhko bata de wajah


Tere bin main yun kaise jiya
Kaise jiya tere bin
Tere bin main yun kaise jiya
Kaise jiya tere bin
Tere bin main yun kaise jiya
Kaise jiya tere bin
Tere bin main yun kaise jiya
Kaise jiya tere bin
Tere bin, tere bin, tere bin
Tere bin, tere bin
Tere bin kaise jiya","['party', 'romance', 'self-love']"

Wrote some songs about Ricky
Now I listen and laugh
Even almost got married
And for Pete, I'm so thankful

One taught me patience
And one taught me pain

When I picture my hometown
There's a bronze, spray-tanned statue of you
And a plaque underneath it
That threatens to push me down the stairs at our school


And it was always the same searing pain
But I dreamed that one day I could say


All that time you were throwin' punches, I was buildin' somethin'
And I can't forgive the way you made me feel
Screamed, "Fuck you, Aimee" to the night sky as the blood was gushin'
But I can't forget the way you made me heal


And it wasn't a fair fight
Or a clean kill each time that Aimee stompеd across my grave
And then she wrotе headlines
In the local paper, laughing at each baby step I'd take


And it was always the same searing pain
But I prayed that one day I could say

Everyone knows that my mother is a saintly woman
But she used to say she wished that you were dead
I pushed each boulder up the hill
Your words are still just ringin' in my head, ringin' in my head


I wrote a thousand songs that you find uncool
I built a legacy that you can't undo
But when I count the scars, there's a moment of truth
That there wouldn't be this if there hadn't been you


And maybe you've reframed it
And in your mind, you never beat my spirit black and blue
I don't think you've changed much
And so I changed your name and any real defining clues
And one day, your kid comes home singin'
A song that only us two is gonna know is about you, 'cause


All that time you were throwin' punches, it was all for nothin'
And our town, it looks so small from way up here
Screamed, "Thank you, Aimee" to the night sky and the stars are stunnin'
'Cause I can't forget the way you made me heal
Everyone knows that my mother is a saintly woman

Let me find out and see, comin' over to me, yeah


These days, I'm way too lonely
I'm missing out, I know
These days, I'm way too alone
And I'm known for givin' love away, but


I want someone to love mе
I need someone who needs me
'Causе it don't feel right when it's late at night
And it's just me and my dreams
So I want someone to love
That's what I fuckin' want


Look, you know it's harder to find in these times
But I got nothin' but love on my mind (My mind)
I need a baby with love in my prime
Need an adversary to my "down and weary"
Like, tell me "That's life" when I'm stressin' at night
Be like, "You'll be okay" and, "Everything is alright," uh
Let me in that thing, 'cause I'm not wanting anything
But your loving, your body, and a little bit of your brain


These days, I'm way too lonely
I'm missing out, I know
These days, I'm way too alone
And I'm known for givin' love away, but


I want someone to love me
I need someone who needs me
'Cause it don't feel right when it's late at night
And it's just me and my dreams
So I want someone to love
That's what I fuckin' want


I want someone to love me

I'm doing good, I'm on some new shit
Been saying "yes" instead of "no"
I thought I saw you at the bus stop, I didn't though
I hit the ground running each night
I hit the Sunday matinée
You know the greatest films of all time were never made


I guess you never know, never know
And if you wanted me, you really should've showed
And if you never bleed, you're never gonna grow
And it's alright now


But we were something, don't you think so?
Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool
And if my wishes came true
It would've been you
In my defense, I have none
For never leaving well enough alone
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one
(Ooh)


I have this dream you're doing cool shit
Having adventures on your own
You meet some woman on the internet and take her home
We never painted by the numbers, baby
But we were making it count
You know the greatest loves of all time are over now
You might also like
I guess you never know, never know
And it's another day waking up alone


But we were something, don't you think so?
Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool
And if my wishes came true
It would've been you
In my defense, I have none
For never leaving well enough alone
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one


I, I, I persist and resist the temptation to ask you
If one thing had been different
Would everything be different today?


We were something, don't you think so?
Rosé flowing with your chosen family
And it would've been sweet
If it could've been me
In my defense, I have none
For digging up the grave another time
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one

Wise men once said
"Wild winds are death to the candle"
A rose by any other name is a scandal
Cautions issued, he stood
Shooting the messengers
They tried to warn him about her


Cross your thoughtless heart
Only liquor anoints you
She's the albatross
She is here to destroy you


Wise men once said
"One bad seed kills the garden"
"One less temptress, one less dagger to sharpen"
Locked me up in towers
But I'd visit in your dreams
And they tried to warn you about me


Cross your thoughtless heart
Only liquor anoints you
She's the albatross
She is here to destroy you
Devils that you know
Raise worse hell than a stranger
She's the death you chose
You're in terrible danger
You might also like
And when that sky rains fire on you
And you're persona non grata
I'll tell you how I've been there too
And that none of it matters


Wise men once read fake news
And they believed it
Jackals raised their hackles
You couldn't conceive it
You were sleeping soundly
When they dragged you from your bed
And I tried to warn you about them


So I crossed my thoughtless heart
Spread my wings like a parachute
I'm the albatross
I swept in at the rescue
The devil that you know
Looks now more like an angel
I'm the life you chose
And all this terrible danger
(This terrible danger)

So cross your thoughtless heart

This happens once every few lifetimes
These chemicals hit me like white wine
What if I told you I'm back?
The hospital was a drag
Worst sleep that I ever had
I circled you on a map
I haven't come around in so long
But I'm coming back so strong


So when I touch down
Call the amateurs and cut 'em from the team
Ditch the clowns, get the crown
Baby, I'm the one to beat
'Cause the sign on your heart
Said it's still reserved for me
Honestly, who are we to fight thе alchemy?


Hey, you, what if I told you we'rе cool?
That child's play back in school
Is forgiven under my rule
I haven't come around in so long

'Cause the sign on your heart

Honestly, who are we to fight the alchemy?


Shirts off and your friends lift you up over their heads
Beer stickin' to the floor, cheers chanted 'cause they said

Combat, I'm ready for combat
I say I don't want that, but what if I do?
'Cause cruelty wins in the movies
I've got a hundred thrown-out speeches I almost said to you


Easy they come, easy they go
I jump from the train, I ride off alone
I never grew up, it's getting so old
Help me hold on to you


I've been the archer, I've been the prey
Who could ever leave me, darling
But who could stay?


Dark side, I search for your dark side
But what if I'm alright, right, right, right here?
And I cut off my nose just to spite my face
Then I hate my reflection for years and years


I wake in the night, I pace like a ghost
The room is on fire, invisible smoke
And all of my heroes die all alone
Help me hold on to you

I've been the archer, I've been the prey
Screaming, who could ever leave me, darling
But who could stay?

They see right through
Can you see right through me?
They see right through
They see right through me
I see right through me

All the king's horses, all the king's men
Couldn't put me together again
'Cause all of my enemies started out friends
Help me hold on to you


I've been the archer, I've been the prey
Who could ever leave me, darling

Stuck in her daydream

Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
"The worst things in life come free to us"


'Cause we're just under the upper hand

I am someone who until recent events
You shared your secrets with
And your location, you forgot to turn it off
And so I watch as you walk
Into some bar called The Black Dog
And pierce new holes in my heart
You forgot to turn it off
And it hits me


I just don't understand
How you don't miss me in The Black Dog
When someone plays "The Starting Line"
And you jump up, but she's too young to know this song
That was intertwined in the magic fabric of our dreaming
Old habits die screaming


I move through the world with the heartbroken
My longings stay unspoken
And I may never open up thе way I did for you
And all of those best laid plans
You said I needed a bravе man
Then proceeded to play him
Until I believed it too
And it kills me
You might also like
I just don't understand
How you don't miss me in the shower
And remember how my rain-soaked body
Was shakin', do you hate me?
Was it hazing? For a cruel fraternity
I pledged and I still mean it
Old habits die screaming


Six weeks of breathin' clean air
I still miss the smoke
Were you makin' fun of me
With some esoteric joke?
Now I wanna sell my house
And set fire to all my clothes
And hire a priest to come and exorcise my demons
Even if I die screaming
And I hope you hear it


And I hope it's shitty in The Black Dog
When someone plays "The Starting Line"
And you jump up, but she's too young to know this song
That was intertwined in the tragic fabric of our dreaming
'Cause tail between your legs, you're leavin'

Now I wanna sell my house
And set fire to all my clothes
And hire a priest to come and exorcise my demons
Even if I die screaming
And I hope you hear it


And I hope it's shitty in The Black Dog
When someone plays "The Starting Line"
And you jump up, but she's too young to know this song
That was intertwined in the tragic fabric of our dreaming
'Cause tail between your legs, you're leavin'


I still can't believe it
'Cause old habits die screaming","['sadness', 'adventure', 'nostalgia']"

By all accounts, she almost drowned
When she was six in frigid water
And I can confirm she made
A curious child, ever reviled
By everyone except her own father
With a quite bewitching face
Splendidly selfish, charmingly helpless
Excellent fun 'til you get to know her
Then she runs like it's a race
Behind her back, her best mates laughed
And they nicknamed her "The Bolter"


Started with a kiss
"Oh, we must stop meeting like this"
But it always ends up with a town car speeding
Out the drive one evening
Ended with the slam of a door
Then he'll call her a whore
Wish he wouldn't be sore
But as she was leaving
It felt like breathing


All her fuckin' lives
Flashed before her eyes
It feels like the time
She fell through the ice
Then came out alive
You might also like
He was a cad, wanted her bad
Just like any good trophy hunter
And she liked the way it tastes
Taming a bear, making him care
Watching him jump then pulling him under
And at first blush, this is fate
When it's all roses, portrait poses
Central Park Lake in tiny rowboats
What a charming Saturday
That's when she sees the littlest leaks
Down in the floorboards
And she just knows she must bolt


Started with a kiss
"Oh, we must stop meeting like this"
But it always ends up with a town car speeding
Out the drive one evening
Ended with the slam of a door
Then he'll call her a whore
Wish he wouldn't be sore
But as she was leaving
It felt like breathing


All her fuckin' lives
Flashed before her eyes (Ah-ah-ah)
It feels like the time
She fell through the ice
Then came out alive

She's been many places with
Men of many faces
First, they're off to the races
And she's laughing, drawin' aces
But none of it is changin'
That the chariot is waitin'
Hearts are hers for the breakin'
There's escape in escaping


Started with a kiss
"Oh, we must stop meeting like this"
But it always ends up with a town car speeding
Out the drive one evening
Ended with the slam of a door
But she's got the best stories
You can be sure
That as she was leaving
It felt like freedom

She sucked a nigga soul, gotta Cash App
Told 'em wipe a nigga nose, say slatt, slatt
I won't never sell my soul, and I can back that
And I really wanna know where you at, at


I was out back where the stash at
Cruise the city in a bulletproof Cadillac (Skrrt)
'Cause I know these niggas after where the bag at (Yeah)
Gotta move smarter, gotta move harder
Nigga try to get me for my water
I'll lay his ass down, on my son, on my daughter

Lotta niggas out here playin', ain't ballin'

Rebekah rode up on the afternoon train, it was sunny
Her saltbox house on the coast took her mind off St. Louis
Bill was the heir to the Standard Oil name and money
And the town said, "How did a middle-class divorcée do it?"
The wedding was charming, if a little gauche
There's only so far new money goes
They picked out a home and called it "Holiday House"
Their parties were tasteful, if a little loud
The doctor had told him to settle down
It must have been her fault his heart gave out


And they said
"There goes the last great American dynasty
Who knows, if she never showed up, what could've been
There goes the maddest woman this town has ever seen
She had a marvelous time ruining everything"


Rebekah gave up on the Rhode Island set forever
Flew in all her Bitch Pack friends from the city
Filled the pool with champagne and swam with the big names
And blew through the money on the boys and the ballet
And losing on card game bets with Dalí
You might also like
And they said
"There goes the last great American dynasty
Who knows, if she never showed up, what could've been
There goes the most shameless woman this town has ever seen
She had a marvelous time ruining everything"


They say she was seen on occasion
Pacing the rocks, staring out at the midnight sea
And in a feud with her neighbor
She stole his dog and dyed it key lime green
Fifty years is a long time
Holiday House sat quietly on that beach
Free of women with madness, their men and bad habits
And then it was bought by me


Who knows, if I never showed up, what could've been
There goes the loudest woman this town has ever seen
I had a marvelous time ruining everything


I had a marvelous time ruining everything
A marvelous time ruining everything
A marvelous time
I had a marvelous time73Embed

Rebekah rode up on the afternoon train, it was sunny
Her saltbox house on the coast took her mind off St. Louis
Bill was the heir to the Standard Oil name and money
And the town said, "How did a middle-class divorcée do it?"
The wedding was charming, if a little gauche
There's only so far new money goes
They picked out a home and called it "Holiday House"
Their parties were tasteful, if a little loud
The doctor had told him to settle down
It must have been her fault his heart gave out


And they said
"There goes the last great American dynasty
Who knows, if she never showed up, what could've been
There goes the maddest woman this town has ever seen
She had a marvelous time ruining everything"


Rebekah gave up on the Rhode Island set forever
Flew in all her Bitch Pack friends from the city
Filled the pool with champagne and swam with the big names
And blew through the money on the boys and the ballet
And losing on card game bets with Dalí


And they said
"There goes the last great American dynasty
Who knows, if she never showed up, what could've been
There goes the most shameless woman this town has ever seen
She had a marvelous time ruining everything"


They say she was seen on occasion
Pacing the rocks, staring out at the midnight sea
And in a feud with her neighbor
She stole his dog and dyed it key lime green
Fifty years is a long time
Holiday House sat quietly on that beach
Free of women with madness, their men and bad habits
And then it was bought by me


Who knows, if I never showed up, what could've been
There goes the loudest woman this town has ever seen
I had a marvelous time ruining everything


I had a marvelous time ruining everything
A marvelous time ruining everything
A marvelous time
I had a marvelous time","['sadness', 'adventure', 'empowerment']"

I would be complex, I would be cool
They'd say I played the field before I found someone to commit to
And that would be okay for me to do
Every conquest I had made would make me more of a boss to you


I’d be a fearless leader, I'd be an alpha type
When everyone believes ya, what's that like?


I’m so sick of running as fast as I can
Wonderin' if I'd get there quicker if I was a man
And I'm so sick of them comin' at me again
'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man
I'd be the man (Man)
I’d be the man (Man)


They’d say I hustled, put in the work
They wouldn't shake their heads and question how much of this I deserve
What I was wearing, if I was rude
Could all be separated from my good ideas and power moves


And they would toast to me, oh (Ayy), let the players play
I’d be just like Leo in Saint-Tropez

I'm so sick of running as fast as I can

What's it like to brag about raking in dollars

And it's all good if you're bad

They'd paint me out to be bad

Now and then, she rereads the manuscript
Of the entire torrid affair
They compared their licenses
He said, "I'm not a donor but
I'd give you my heart if you needed it"
She rolled her eyes and said
"You're a professional"
He said, "No, just a good samaritan"
He said that if the sex was half as good as the conversation was
Soon, they'd be pushin' strollers
But, soon, it was over


In the age of him, she wished she was thirty
And made coffee every morning in a Frеnch press
Afterwards, she only atе kids' cereal
And couldn't sleep unless it was in her mother's bed
Then she dated boys who were her own age
With dart boards on the backs of their doors
She thought about how he said since she was so wise beyond her years
Everything had been above board
She wasn't sure


And the years passed like scenes of a show
The professor said to write what you know
Lookin' backwards might be the only way to move forward
Then the actors were hitting their marks
And the slow dance was alight with the sparks
And the tears fell in synchronicity with the score
And at last, she knew what the agony had been for

Summer after high school, when we first met
We'd make out in your Mustang to Radiohead
And on my eighteenth birthday, we got matching tattoos
Used to steal your parents' liquor and climb to the roof
Talked about our future like we had a clue
Never planned that one day, I'd be losing you


In another life
I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises
Be us against the world
In another life
I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were
The one that got away
The one that got away


I was June, and you were my Johnny Cash
Never one without the other, we made a pact
Sometimes when I miss you, I put those records on, woah
Someone said you had your tattoo removed
Saw you downtown, singing the blues
It's time to face the music, I'm no longer your muse

Like a spotlight the water hits me
Ran it extra cold to shake the words from my mouth
Though I know that no one’s listening

And I keep waiting like you might change my mind

There's never been a way to make this easy
When there's nothing quite wrong but it don't feel right
Either your head or your heart, you set the other on fire


Back and forth now I'm feelin' guilty
'Cause I just can't stop this pendulum in my head
Though I know that our time is ending
Oh, I'd rather lay forever right in this bed
And I keep waiting like, you might change my mind

Two, one, two, three, four


Hand on the throttle
Thought I caught lightning in a bottle
Oh, but it's gone again
And it was written
I got cursed like Eve got bitten
Oh, was it punishment?
Pad around when I get home
I guess a lesser woman would've lost hope
A greater woman wouldn't beg
But I looked to the sky and said


"Please
I've been on my knees
Change the prophecy
Don't want money
Just someone who wants my company
Let it once be me
Who do I have to speak to
About if they can redo the prophеcy?"


Cards on the table
Mine play out likе fools in a fable
Oh, it was sinking in (Sinking in, oh)
Slow is the quicksand
Poison blood from the wound of the pricked hand
Oh, still I dream of him

And I sound like an infant
Feeling like the very last drops of an ink pen
A greater woman stays cool
But I howl like a wolf at the moon
And I look unstable
Gathered with a coven 'round a sorceress' table
A greater woman has faith
But even statues crumble if they're made to wait
I'm so afraid I sealed my fate
No sign of soulmates
I'm just a paperweight in shades of greige
Spending my last coin so someone will tell me it'll be okay
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Come up to meet you, tell you I'm sorry
You don't know how lovely you are
I had to find you, tell you I need you
And tell you I set you apart
Tell me your secrets and ask me your questions
No, let's go back to the start
Runnin' in circles, comin' up tails
Heads on a science apart


Nobody said it was easy
It's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be this hard
Oh, take me back to the start

I was just guessin' at numbers and figures
Pullin' your puzzles apart
Questions of science, science and progress
Do not speak as loud as my heart
And tell me you love me, come back and haunt me
Oh, and I rush to the start
Runnin' in circles, chasin' our tails
Comin' back as we are

Was any of it true?
Gazing at me starry-eyed
In your Jehovah's Witness suit
Who the fuck was that guy?
You tried to buy some pills
From a friend of friends of mine
They just ghosted you
Now you know what it feels like


And I don't even want you back, I just want to know
If rusting my sparkling summer was the goal
And I don't miss what we had, but could someone give
A message to the smallest man who ever lived?


You hung me on your wall
Stabbed me with your push pins
In public, showed me off
Then sank in stoned oblivion
'Cause once your queen had come
You'd treat her likе an also-ran
You didn't measure up
In any measurе of a man
You might also like
And I don't even want you back, I just want to know
If rusting my sparkling summer was the goal
And I don't miss what we had, but could someone give
A message to the smallest man who ever lived?


Were you sent by someone who wanted me dead?
Did you sleep with a gun underneath our bed?
Were you writin' a book? Were you a sleeper cell spy?
In fifty years, will all this be declassified?
And you'll confess why you did it and I'll say, "Good riddance"
'Cause it wasn't sexy once it wasn't forbidden
I would've died for your sins, instead, I just died inside
And you deserve prison, but you won't get time
You'll slide into inboxes and slip through the bars
You crashed my party and your rental car
You said normal girls were boring
But you were gone by the morning
You kicked out the stage lights, but you're still performing


And in plain sight you hid
But you are what you did
And I'll forget you, but I'll never forgive
The smallest man who ever lived8Embed

Stick, stick to your stones 'cause that's all you know
I was caught in the middle
I swallow my words down through the bone
'Cause nothing's that simple


Late at night, you pour it out
Know that only brings you down


But go ahead give me all the blame
Twist my words and set them to flame, woah
We all know
That you'll go tell all of your friends
That I'm the one you wish you never met
And woah

The story never ends, ends
The story never ends, ends


Wound me like a toy spinning too fast
In every direction
How, how could I stay when you lit a match to all my intentions?

You left your typewriter at my apartment
Straight from the tortured poets department
I think some things I never say
Like, "Who uses typewriters anyway?"
But you're in self-sabotage mode
Throwing spikes down on the road
But I've seen this episode and still loved the show
Who else decodes you?


And who's gonna hold you like me?
And who's gonna know you, if not me?
I laughed in your face and said
"You're not Dylan Thomas, I'm not Patti Smith
This ain't the Chelsea Hotel, we'rе modern idiots"
And who's gonna hold you like me?


Nobody
No-fucking-body
Nobody


You smokеd, then ate seven bars of chocolate
We declared Charlie Puth should be a bigger artist
I scratch your head, you fall asleep
Like a tattooed golden retriever
But you awaken with dread
Pounding nails in your head
But I've read this one where you come undone
I chose this cyclone with you
You might also like
And who's gonna hold you like me?
(Who's gonna hold you? Who's gonna hold you?)

Sometimes, I wonder if you're gonna screw this up with me
But you told Lucy you'd kill yourself if I ever leave
And I had said that to Jack about you, so I felt seen
Everyone we know understands why it's meant to be
'Cause we're crazy
So tell me, who else is gonna know me?
At dinner, you take my ring off my middle finger
And put it on the one people put wedding rings on
And that's the closest I've come to my heart exploding

When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?
And darlin', I will be lovin' you till we're seventy
And baby, my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three


And I'm thinkin' 'bout how
People fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well, me, I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am


So honey, now, take me into your lovin' arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
And place your head on my beatin' heart, I'm thinkin' out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are


When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way, mmm
I know you will still love me the same

Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well, me, I fall in love with you every single day

Got money, retarded
Don't want her if it don't clap when she walking
Ain't too pretty in the face, but she super thick
I'm just thinking with my dick
My shit dumb
I'm just thinking with my dick
My shit dumb
I'm just thinking with my dick


Skip the line, on my mind
VIP going mad
Bands a make her dance
With a bag full of Xans
Got my Vans in advance
Acting bad on them tabs
Pants cost a grand
Put that ass in my hands
Duffel bag full of cash
She a model? I'ma get her
Seen 'em now
She stop, popped, and squat by the zipper
Thinking out loud
My dick probably tryna kill her
Help her somebody
The bitch wiped on the liquor
Going live
Long hair, shawty ride like Geronimo
Say I got the gas
We ain't talkin' 'bout Conoco
Knock the whole clique down
I'm talking like dominoes

Vou te contar uma história, antes que ela se conte sozinha

Eles estão com as mãos em meu pescoço dessa vez
Mas é você que eu quero e se isso for tão errado assim

Clear blue water
High tide came and brought you in
And I could go on and on, on and on, and I will
Skies grew darker
Currents swept you out again
And you were just gone and gone, gone and gone


In silent screams, in wildest dreams
I never dreamed of this

This love is alive back from the dead (Oh-oh-oh)
These hands had to let it go free and
This love came back to me (Oh-oh-oh)

Waking up to kiss you and nobody’s there
The smell of your perfume still stuck in the air
It’s hard
Yesterday I thought I saw your shadow running round
It’s funny how things never change in this old town
So far from the stars


And I want to tell you everything
The words I never got to say the first time around
And I remember everything
From when we were the children playing in this fairground
Wish I was there with you now


If the whole world was watching I’d still dance with you
Drive highways and byways to be there with you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you


I saw that you moved on with someone new
In the pub that we met he’s got his arms around you

Waking up to kiss you and nobody’s there
The smell of your perfume still stuck in the air
It’s hard
Yesterday I thought I saw your shadow running round
It’s funny how things never change in this old town
So far from the stars


And I want to tell you everything
The words I never got to say the first time around
And I remember everything
From when we were the children playing in this fairground
Wish I was there with you now


If the whole world was watching I’d still dance with you
Drive highways and byways to be there with you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you


I saw that you moved on with someone new
In the pub that we met he’s got his arms around you
It’s so hard
So hard

And I want to tell you everything
The words I never got to say the first time around
And I remember everything
From when we were the children playing in this fairground

Ooh, evet, ooh, evet, hayır


Küçüklüğümden beri, olayın ben olduğunu biliyordum (Ooh, evet)
Hatun sürekli gelmek istiyor, çakılmak istiyor (Çok sert çakılmak istiyor)
Yanımda tuttuğum için ilkim olduğunu zannediyor
Çift O, saati kapla, benim zamansız olduğumu biliyor (Zamansız)
Oğluma bir kaç parça Rick geçiriyorum
Silahı kalçadan çekiyorum
Cepler yirmi ikilik klipleri tutuyor (Ah)
Kalbini kırıyorum, Comme Garçons
Üstüne bir şey giy, zeplin üstüne basıl
Leke gibi bir sürtük, yalamaya hazır ol
Küçüklüğümden beri, olayın ben olduğunu bildiğimi anlatmak zorundaydım (Oh)
Şarkılarımı söylüyor, kendinden geçmek istiyor, bir fırt çekmeye çalışıyor
Banka gibi ev, bu orospuyu yatır, şu çeki yatır
Yüzümde gülümseme, rol yapmıyorum, gel ve kontrol edil (Ah)
Boynumda buz, çift O bilekler
Kız cennette, ne tekerler ama
Siperlerden yeni çıktı, dört yüz paket
Ah, evet, Paris'te dönüp dolaşıyorum (Ah)
Orospular için giyin, üstüne akın edecekler
Gazoza dört damla koydum, baloncukları çıkıyor
Uyuşturucular iyi vuracak, hasta gibiyim

No, I can't leave here sorry, if I just let this go
Don't wanna hear my heart say, "I told you so"

Still lost, but I, I'll find my way tonight

I sit and watch you readin' with your head low
I wake and watch you breathin' with your eyes closed
I sit and watch you
I notice everything you do or don't do
You're so much older and wiser, and I


I wait by the door like I'm just a kid
Use my best colors for your portrait
Lay the table with the fancy shit
And watch you tolerate it
If it's all in my head, tell me now
Tell me I've got it wrong somehow
I know my love should be celebrated
But you tolerate it


I greet you with a battle hero's welcome
I take your indiscretions all in good fun
I sit and listеn
I polish plates until they gleam and glistеn
You're so much older and wiser, and I


I wait by the door like I'm just a kid
Use my best colors for your portrait

Drawin' hearts in the byline
Always takin' up too much space or time
You assume I'm fine, but what would you do if I (I)


Break free and leave us in ruins?
Took this dagger in me and removed it
Gain the weight of you, then lose it

It can't be said I'm an early bird

Baby, I can never tell
How do you sleep so well?
You keep tellin' me to live right
To go to bed before the daylight
But then you wake up for the sunrise
You know you don't gotta pretend
Baby, now and then


Don't you just wanna wake up, dark as a lake
Smellin' like a bonfire, lost in a haze?
If you're drunk on life, babe, I think it's great
But while in this world


I think I'll take my whiskey neat
My coffee black and my bed at 3

Siento un vacío muy frío por dentro, mi amor
Cuando te fuiste, te robaste mi corazón
Me quedé loco de tanto pensar y pensar
Me iré al infierno, pero me tengo que vengar
Quiero manchar el vestido blanco de rojo
Sé que el altar dе Dios es santo, pero, mi amor
Cien invitados y todos tеndrán que mirar
Que nuestro amor va al más allá


Quiero que bailemos juntos
En el cielo, el infierno, pero sin ese puto
El que te ha apartado todo este tiempo de mí
Al inconsciente que hizo que no fueras pa' mí
Danza, una danza eterna
Pero me voy contigo, pero nos vamos juntos
Llevo tres noches malditas sin poder dormir
Solo pensando y pensando que eres para mí (Que eres para mí)

Ya no hay razón pa' estar de pie


Quiero que bailemos juntos
En el cielo, el infierno, pero sin ese puto
Al que te ha apartado todo este tiempo de mí
Al inconsciente que hizo que no fueras pa' mí
Danza, una danza eterna
Pero me voy contigo, pero nos vamos juntos
Llevo tres noches malditas sin poder dormir
Solo pensando y pensando que eras para mí

Miro cómo brillan tus ojos
Me resigno perderte y esta vez para siempre
Me arrepentí de quitarte tu felicidad
Te dejaré una familia puedas comenzar
Me despido, me despido pa' siempre
Y te deseo suerte, y bendigo mi muerte
Se la dedico al amor que nunca funcionó
A la persona que roto tiene el corazón

Siento un vacío muy frío por dentro, mi amor
Cuando te fuiste, te robaste mi corazón
Me quedé loco de tanto pensar y pensar
Me iré al infierno, pero me tengo que vengar
Quiero manchar el vestido blanco de rojo
Sé que el altar dе Dios es santo, pero, mi amor
Cien invitados y todos tеndrán que mirar
Que nuestro amor va al más allá

Camino lento, me duele la respiración
A mil por hora latidos de mi corazón
En el pasillo me vienen recuerdos, flashbacks
Prometimos que los dos iríamos al altar
Te quitó el velo, aceptaste y luego te besó
Ya has consumado los votos sagrados, mi amor
Un frío muy intenso se llevó todo mi ser
Ya no hay razón pa' estar de pie

चलती हो इतरा के, इठला के, शर्मा के
बलखा के जैसे कोई रागिनी

तुम्हें जो मैंने समझा, तुम्हें जो पहचाना
तुम्हें जो मैंने देखा, तुम्हें जो मैंने जाना
जो होश था वो तो गया
बदन की ये खुशबू जगाने लगी जादू
तो होके बेक़ाबू दिल खो गया


तुम्हें जो मैंने देखा, तुम्हें जो मैंने जाना
तुम्हें जो मैंने देखा, तुम्हें जो मैंने जाना

तुम्हें जो मैंने देखा, तुम्हें जो मैंने जाना
जो होश था वो तो गया
बदन की ये खुशबू जगाने लगी जादू
तो होके बेक़ाबू दिल खो गया


तुम्हें जो मैंने सोचा, तुम्हें जो मैंने माना
तुम्हें जो मैंने देखा, तुम्हें जो मैंने जाना
जो होश था वो तो गया




इतनी क्यूँ तुम खूबसूरत हो?
कि सबको हैरत हो, दुनिया में सचमुच ही रहती है
परियों से भी ज़्यादा प्यारी सी लड़की कोई

हाँ, इतनी क्यूँ बोलो हसीं तुम हो?
जो देखे गुमसुम हो, देखो ना मैं भी हूँ खोया सा
बहका सा, मुझ पे भी छाई है दीवानगी


तुम ही को मैंने पूजा, तुम ही को चाहा पाना
तुम्हें जो मैंने देखा, तुम्हें जो मैंने जाना
जो होश था वो तो गया
बदन की ये खुशबू जगाने लगी जादू
तो होके बेक़ाबू दिल खो गया


तुम्हें जो मैंने देखा, तुम्हें जो मैंने जाना
तुम्हें जो मैंने देखा, तुम्हें जो मैंने जाना
जो होश था वो तो गया




तुम भी हो, मैं भी हूँ, पास आओ तो कह दूँ
तुम ने जो देखा तो क्या जाने क्या हो गया

जाने क्यूँ रहती हूँ खोई सी, जागी ना सोई सी
अब दिल में अरमाँ हैं, साँसों में तूफ़ाँ है
आखों में ख़ाबों की है चाँदनी


हाँ, जाने क्यूँ बहका सा ये मन है
महका सा ये तन है
चलती हो इतरा के, इठला के, शर्मा के
बलखा के जैसे कोई रागिनी


तुम्हें जो मैंने समझा, तुम्हें जो पहचाना

इश्क़ जैसे है एक आँधी, इश्क़ है एक तूफ़ाँ
इश्क़ के आगे बेबस है, दुनिया में हर इंसाँ
इश्क़ में सब दीवाने हैं, इश्क़ में सब हैराँ
इश्क़ में सबकुछ मुश्किल है, इश्क़ में सब आसाँ
देखो प्यारे, ये नज़ारे, ये दीवाने, ये परवाने हैं इश्क़ में कैसे गुम


हाए, तुमसे मिलके दिल का है जो हाल, क्या कहें
हो गया है कैसा ये कमाल, क्या कहें
तुमसे मिलके दिल का है जो हाल, क्या कहें

(Glizock, pop your shit, boy)
Watch over your shoulder, nigga
Shit get real out here, fool
Ah
(KUNICA on the beat)


I might swerve, bend that corner, woah
Bitch, hold on tight 'cause I'll tweak in this bitch, start lettin' shit go
And I heard that she wanna show
Me who she be, I'm kinda fuckin' with it, show me some more
Bitch, we tatted head to toe, could give a fuck, the story wrote
You wanna tweak? Get up with me and I'ma show you how that go
Like the money in my pockets, blow
They havin' convos about me, these pussy niggas don't know


Tell me what they talkin' 'bout, I ain't fuckin' listenin'
Let your thoughts run your mouth, but ain't touchin' dividends
Nigga, I ain't from the South, but kick it with my Memphis twin
Nigga, I can't take a loss, I'm always goin' for the win (For the win)
I been geeked up in this booth, I got my blunt packed for the starter
Nigga, don't be here actin' new, they'll put some holes all through your body
I'm like "Oh, them hoes is cool, let 'em in if that shit water" (Water)
See a nigga actin' bothered, got my green light to red dot 'em (Red dot, red dot)
If you spot me, ho, I'm sorry, I can't take you, it get gnarly (Get gnarly)
Look like your nigga want smoke, well, we gon' do this shit regardless (Regardless)
And I started from the bottom, just like you, but I was harder (Way harder)
I came up a fuckin' soldier, nigga, shout out to my father (Shout out my father)
Ah-ah
He made sure I'll make it farther
Ah-ah (Ah-ah-ah-ah)

With my evil twin, all black hoodies, we hit the streets again (Hoodies)
He don't like attention, he'll tweak and get to reapin' shit
What your ass expect? We drove the whole way in a Demon, bitch (Demon)
He'll pop out, won't think twice and make you greet the switch (Pop out)
Ah-ha-ha, is you sure you wanna meet that bitch?
If I see ill intentions, we'll make sure you get to bleedin' quick (Bleedin')
All exotic whips, the whole damn gang be in some rocket ships (Rocket ship)
Pull up to the scene, my best advice is to hide your bitch (Hide your bitch)
I can see the lies all on your face because your eyes'll twitch (Twitchy, twitchy)
The black ski mask all on our fuckin' faces be disguisin' shit (Disguise)
I might have my way with your bay-bay, you wanna cry and shit
Rest my Glock against her fuckin' waist, I got some pottery
Ah-ah, ah-ah
She my bitch now, my apologies
Don't need no more enemies, you rock with me? Then rock with me
But I'ma keep it real, she lost respect when you said, "Follow me"

Wish I could get a little un-drunk so I could un-call you
At 5 in the morning, I would un-fuck you


Honestly, this party's over
Everyone here shoulda gone home
But I'm afraid of being sober
'Cause the first thing I do when I'm alone


I start touching myself to the photos that you used to send me
I should have deleted, but kept it a secret
Is that crazy to do?
So I squeeze out the lime on the ice of my drink
And the juice hits the cuts on my fingers
It still doesn't burn as much as the thought of you


Wish I could get a little un-drunk so I could un-call you
At 5 in the morning, I would un-fuck you
But some things you can't undo
I wish I could un-kiss the room full of strangers
So I could un-spite you, un-lose my temper
But some things you can't undo
And one of them's you

Been through every emotion
Right now, I'm sad and broken
Like the bottles on the floor, but I'm too buzzed to clean 'em up

So I could, I could un-love you

Ayy


It could be love and we could be homies
Once you get to know me
I could be your one and only
I could make you unlonely (Oh)
We could take it slowly
And we could keep it low-key
I could be your one and only
I could make you unlonely


I've been chasing summer around
Searching for the sunshine, looking for a good time
Following the good vibes
Listening to intuition as it's happening
Diggin' into life 'cause at times it can be saddening
Yeah, it can be a grey day, if you're lonely
A little rain suddenly turns heavy
But a whole lotta love can make the clouds go away
Maybe the time for us is now


When the table's set for two
And there's nobody with you
Seeing movies by yourself
Let me be your someone else

Love, la-la-la, love, love
Love, la-la, love
One and only, I could make you unlonely


I give you my word, although I'm making words up
Unlonely ain't a word, but I don't give a fuck
'Cause I'm fresh from the farm where critics can't bother me
Living is tricky as it is, so that ain't stopping me
You and me we both agree that no one needs the scrutiny
All we want is peace and love, and honestly, you ruin me
With your beautiful smile and your style continuity
I'd be a fool not to take the opportunity to say
Hey, we should be homies
I think we could be bigger than cheese and macaroni
We could keep it sweet like Chachi and Joanie
Or maybe just be ourselves: never phony
Never second guessing the friendship connection
Parallel living, never in possession
Of your individual personal expression
Together we're just a much better reflection of love

And we could be homies
Once you get to know me
I could be your one and only
I could make you unlonely (Oh)
We could take it slowly
And we could keep it low-key

If you're spending time alone
If it's just you and your phone
Taking pictures of yourself
Baby, maybe I can help

It could be love
And we could be homies
Once you get to know me

Staring at the blank page before you
Open up the dirty window
Let the sun illuminate the words that you cannot find
Reaching for something in the distance
So close you can almost taste it
Release your inhibitions


Feel the rain on your skin
No one else can feel it for you
Only you can let it in
No one else, no one else
Can speak the words on your lips
Drench yourself in words unspoken
Live your life with arms wide open

Wait a minute
I think I left my conscience on your front doorstep, woah, woah

Just sitting in a cloud, oh wow
I'm here right now, right now with you, oh wow, oh wow
(Right now, with you)
I don't even care
I’ll run my hands through your hair
You wanna run your fingers through mine
But my dreads too thick and that's alright


Hold on, wait a minute

Hold on, wait a minute

Left my soul in his vision

Some things don't work
Some things are bound to be
Some things, they hurt
And they tear apart me
You left your diary at my house
And I read those pages, do you really love me, baby?
Some things don't work
Some things are bound to be
Some things, they hurt
And they tear apart me
But I broke my word, and you were bound to see

Feelin' my way through the darkness
Guided by a beatin' heart
I can't tell where the journey will end
But I know where to start
They tell me I'm too young to understand
They say I'm caught up in a dream
Well, life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
Well, that's fine by me


So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time, I was findin' myself and I
Didn't know﻿ I was lost
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time, I was findin' myself and I
Didn't know﻿ I was lost






I tried carryin' the weight of the world
But I only have two hands
Hope I get the chance to travel the world
But I don't have any plans
Wish that I could stay forever this young
Not afraid to close my eyes
Life's a game﻿ made for everyone

Summer has come and passed
The innocent can never last
Wake me up when September ends
Like my father's come to pass
Seven years has gone so fast
Wake me up when September ends


Here comes the rain again
Falling from the stars
Drenched in my pain again
Becoming who we are
As my memory rests
But never forgets what I lost
Wake me up when September ends


Summer has come and passed
The innocent can never last
Wake me up when September ends
Ring out the bells again
Like we did when spring began
Wake me up when September ends


Here comes the rain again
Falling from the stars
Drenched in my pain again
Becoming who we are
As my memory rests
But never forgets what I lost

I guess all the mountains that I moved just weren't enough
And all those nights I walked you home
From crowded bars when you were drunk
Well, they meant nothing 'cause you up and walked away
And I just wonder what it'd take to make you stay


'Cause when you said, "Jump", I said, "How high?"
But when I jumped, you said, "Goodbye"


I woulda walked through hell
To find another way
I woulda laid me down
If I knew that you would stay
I woulda crossed the stars
To keep you in my life
But now I'm falling hard
Without you here tonight
Without you here tonight


What did you do with all that love you couldn't give?
And do you need someone to help you?
Tell you what to do with it?
It must be nice to love someone who puts you first
Then walk away when they expect it in return

माना दिल डरा-डरा है, टूटा ये ज़रा-ज़रा है
दिल के इस बवंडर को ठहर जाने दो
होंठ ये ज़रा सिले हैं, ख़ामोशी के सिलसिले हैं
रात थोड़ी गहरी है, सहर आने दो


तो क्या हुआ जो टूटा आज सपना ये तेरा?
तो क्या हुआ जो आज कोई अपना ना मिला?
कभी तो पूरा होगा ये चाहतों का घर
कभी तो मिल ही जाएगा तुझको हमसफ़र


तुझमें ना कमी कोई है, बस तेरा ये दिन बुरा है
वक़्त की ये बातें हैं, इसे गुज़र जाने दो


तो क्या हुआ जो बदला वो जो कहता था यही
"बदल भी जाए दुनिया, मैं रहूँगा बस वही"?
मगर जहाँ ज़रूरत थी, वो रहा नहीं
साथ का तो छोड़ो, ख़याल तक नहीं


जाने दो जो जा चुका है, कौन कब-कहाँ रुका है
बातें ये फ़िज़ूल हैं, इन्हें भूल जाने दो

We left under moonlight
We went with the breeze
I bet on your blue eyes
You set for my green

We moved with the water
The tumble and sway
The slow dance gets harder
As level shorelines fade

So now I'm out drifting away
What can I say
You're barely listening, asleep in
The shade of tidal waves


Someone throw a lifeline
I don't want to drown
I can't hold you closer without just sinking down
Once I'm safe from the deep you're the waves at my feet that just keep pulling me out
By the power of the moonlight, when the tide comes around


You think that I worry about
What I can't see but fear
The truths always blurry somehow
We still hear these heartbeats clear
And yours might be steady now, yeah yours could be true
Mines always heavy with doubt
Like the current dragging on you

Oh when it's gone I'm right back where we start
Waves from so long ago come and crash on my heart
All that we were and I dreamed you to be
Shines so bright on the deep and darkened sea

I remember when we broke up the first time
Sayin', "This is it, I've had enough"
'Cause, like, we hadn't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space, what?
Then you come around again and say
"Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me"
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say, "I hate you," we break up, you call me, "I love you"


Ooh, we called it off again last night, but
Ooh, this time, I'm tellin' you, I'm tellin' you


We are never, evеr, ever gettin' back togеther
We are never, ever, ever gettin' back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever gettin' back together


Like, ever


I'm really gonna miss you pickin' fights
And me fallin' for it, screaming that I'm right
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind

لم نعد نتحدث، لم نعد نتحدث

مثلما فعلتِ أنتِ بسهولة


لا أريد أن أعرف
ما نوع الفستان الذي ترتديه الليلة
إذا كان هو ممسكًا بك بإحكام
مثلما فعلت أنا من قبل

كان يجب أن أعرف أن حبك كان مجرد لعبة

Kaleidoscope of loud heartbeats under coats
Everybody here wanted somethin' more
Searchin' for a sound we hadn't heard before
And it said


"Welcome to New York, it's been waitin' for you"
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
Welcome to New York, it's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
It's a new soundtrack, I could dance to this beat, beat forevermorе
The lights are so bright, but they nеver blind me, me
Welcome to New York, it's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York


When we first dropped our bags on apartment floors
Took our broken hearts, put them in a drawer
Everybody here was someone else before
And you can want who you want
Boys and boys and girls and girls


Welcome to New York, it's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
Welcome to New York, it's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
It's a new soundtrack, I could dance to this beat, beat forevermore
The lights are so bright, but they never blind me, me
Welcome to New York (New York), it's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York

Welcome to the jungle, we got fun and games
We got everything you want, honey, we know the names
We are the people that can find whatever you may need
If you got the money, honey, we got your disease


In the jungle, welcome to the jungle (Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah)
Watch it bring you to your sha-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-knees, knees
Mwah, I, I wanna watch you bleed


Welcome to the jungle, we take it day by day
If you want it, you're gonna bleed, but it's the price you pay
And you're a very sexy girl, who's very hard to please
You can taste the bright lights, but you won't get there for free


In the jungle, welcome to the jungle (Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah)
Feel my, my, my, my serpentine
Oh, ah, I wanna hear you scream

If you got a hunger for what you see, you'll take it eventually
You can have anything you want, but you better not take it from me

Watch it bring you to your sha-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-knees, knees

And when you're high, you never
Ever want to come down
So down, so down, so down
Yeah, now

You're in the jungle, baby
You're gonna die

When Emma falls in love, she paces the floor
Closes the blinds and locks the door
When Emma falls in love, she calls up her mom
Jokes about the ways that this one could go wrong
She waits and takes her time
'Cause Little Miss Sunshine always thinks it's gonna rain
When Emma falls in love, I know
That boy will never be the same


'Cause she's the kind of book that you can't put down
Like if Cleopatra grew up in a small town
And all the bad boys would be good boys
If they only had a chance to love her
And to tell you the truth, sometimes I wish I was her


When Emma falls in love, it's all on her face
Hangs in the air like stars in outer space
When Emma falls in love, she disappears
And we all just laugh after seein' it all these years
When Emma falls apart, it's when she's alone
She takes on the pain and bears it on her own
'Cause when Emma falls in love, she's in it for keeps
She won't walk away unless she knows she absolutely has to leave

And she's the kind of book that you can't put down

Well, she's so New York when she's in L.A.​​
She won't lose herself in love the way that I did
'Cause she'll call you out, she'll put you in your place
When Emma falls in love, I'm learning


Emma met a boy with eyes like a man
Turns out her heart fits right in the palm of his hand
Now he'll be her shelter when it rains
Little does he know, his whole world's about to change


'Cause she's the kind of book that you can't put down
Like if Cleopatra grew up in a small town
And all the bad boys would be good boys
If they only had a chance to love her
And to tell you the truth, sometimes I wish I was her

When Emma falls in love, it's all on her face
Hangs in the air like stars in outer space
When Emma falls in love, she disappears
And we all just laugh after seein' it all these years
When Emma falls apart, it's when she's alone
She takes on the pain and bears it on her own
'Cause when Emma falls in love, she's in it for keeps
She won't walk away unless she knows she absolutely has to leave


And she's the kind of book that you can't put down
Like if Cleopatra grew up in a small town
And all the bad boys would be good boys
If they only had a chance to love her
And to tell you the truth, sometimes I wish I was her


Well, she's so New York when she's in L.A.​​
She won't lose herself in love the way that I did
'Cause she'll call you out, she'll put you in your place
When Emma falls in love, I'm learning


Emma met a boy with eyes like a man
Turns out her heart fits right in the palm of his hand
Now he'll be her shelter when it rains
Little does he know, his whole world's about to change


'Cause she's the kind of book that you can't put down
Like if Cleopatra grew up in a small town
And all the bad boys would be good boys
If they only had a chance to love her
And to tell you the truth, sometimes I wish I was her


Yeah, between me and you, sometimes I wish I was her","['romance', 'adventure', 'empowerment']"

Lyrics
The who's who of "Who's that?" is poised for the attack
But my bare hands paved their paths
You don't get to tell me about "sad"


If you wanted me dead, you should've just said
Nothing makes me feel more alive


So I leap from the gallows and I levitate down your street
Crash the party like a record scratch as I scream
"Who's afraid of little old me?"
You should be


The scandal was contained
The bullet had just grazed
At all costs, keep your good name
You don't get to tell me you feel bad


Is it a wonder I broke? Let's hear one morе joke
Then we could all just laugh until I cry


So I lеap from the gallows and I levitate down your street
Crash the party like a record scratch as I scream
"Who's afraid of little old me?"
I was tame, I was gentle 'til the circus life made me mean
"Don't you worry, folks, we took out all her teeth"

So tell me everything is not about me
But what if it is?
Then say they didn't do it to hurt me
But what if they did?
I wanna snarl and show you just how disturbed this has made me
You wouldn't last an hour in the asylum where they raised me
So all you kids can sneak into my house with all the cobwebs
I'm always drunk on my own tears, isn't that what they all said?
That I'll sue you if you step on my lawn
That I'm fearsome and I'm wretched and I'm wrong
Put narcotics into all of my songs
And that's why you're still singin' along


So I leap from the gallows and I levitate down your street
Crash the party like a record scratch as I scream

He said, "Let's get out of this town
Drive out of the city, away from the crowds"
I thought, "Heaven can't help me now"
Nothing lasts forever
But this is gonna take me down


He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is


Say you'll remember me
Standin' in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah, ha

Things fall apart
And time breaks your heart
I wasn't there, but I know
She was your girl
You showed her the world
But fell out of love and you both let go


She was cryin’ on my shoulder
All I could do was hold her
Only made us closer until July
Now, I know that you love me
You don't need to remind me
I should put it all behind me, shouldn't I?


But I see her in the back of my mind all the time
Like a fever, like I’m burning alive, like a sign

I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night
Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife
And if it was an open-shut case
I never would've known from that look on your face
Lost in your current like a priceless wine


The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man


Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneakin' in
As if you were a mythical thing
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
And there was one prize I'd cheat to win

But I'm scared to be alone (Oh)

ये जिस्म है तो क्या, ये रूह का लिबास है
ये दर्द है तो क्या, ये इश्क़ की तलाश है
फ़ना किया मुझे ये चाहने की आस ने
तरह-तरह शिकस्त ही हुआ


रज़ा है क्या तेरी, दिल-ओ-जहाँ तबाह किया
सज़ा भी क्या तेरी, वफ़ा को बेवफ़ा किया
दुबारा ज़िंदगी से यूँ मुझे जुदा किया
कहाँ-कहाँ फिरूँ मैं ढूँढता?

सज़ा भी क्या तेरी, वफ़ा को बेवफ़ा किया
दुबारा ज़िंदगी से यूँ मुझे जुदा किया
कहाँ-कहाँ फिरूँ मैं ढूँढता?


वहाँ जहाँ तू ही मेरा लिबास है
वहाँ जहाँ तेरी ही बस तलाश है
वहाँ जहाँ तुझी पे ख़त्म आस है
वहीं शुरू, वहीं पे दफ़न जान है

वहाँ जहाँ तू ही मेरा लिबास है
वहाँ जहाँ तेरी ही बस तलाश है
वहाँ जहाँ तुझी पे ख़त्म आस है

One look, dark room, meant just for you
Time moved too fast, you play it back
Buttons on a coat, lighthearted joke
No proof, not much, but you saw enough
Small talk, he drives, coffee at midnight
The light reflects the chain on your neck
He says, "Look up" and your shoulders brush
No proof, one touch, but you felt enough


You can hear it in the silence (Silence), silence (Silence), you
You can feel it on the way home (Way home), way home (Way home), you
You can see it with the lights out (See it with the lights out), lights out (Lights out)
You are in love, true love, you are in lovе


Morning, his place, burnt toast, Sunday
You keep his shirt, he keeps his word
And for once, you lеt go of your fears and your ghosts
One step, not much, but it said enough
You kiss on sidewalks, you fight, then you talk
One night, he wakes, strange look on his face
Pauses, then says, "You're my best friend"
And you knew what it was, he is in love

And so it goes
You two are dancing in a snow globe 'round and 'round
And he keeps a picture of you in his office downtown
And you understand now
Why they lost their minds and fought the wars
And why I've spent my whole life trying to put it into words

I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do


'Cause she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers

If you could see that I'm the onе who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?

You are somebody that I don't know

And I'm just like, damn, it's 7 AM
Say it in the street, that's a knock-out
But you say it in a Tweet, that's a cop-out
And I'm just like, "Hey, are you okay?"


And I ain't tryna mess with your self-expression
But I've learned a lesson that stressin' and obsessin' 'bout somebody else is no fun
And snakes and stones never broke my bones

Is this thing on? Word


So what we get drunk?
So what we smoke weed?
We're just having fun
We don't care who sees (Shit)
So what we go out? (Ayy, lemme get a lighter, please?)
That's how it's supposed to be ('Cause you know I'm high as fuck and I forgot one)
Living young and wild and free (Keep that in there)


Ah, ah-ah
So what, I keep 'em rolled up?
Saggin' my pants, not carin' what I show
Keep it real with my niggas, keep it player for these hoes
It look clean, don't it?
Washed it the other day, watch how you lean on it
Give me some 501 jeans on it
Roll joints bigger than King Kong's fingers
And smoke them hoes down 'til they stingers
You a class clown and if I skip for the day
I'm with your bitch smokin' grade A


You know what? It's like I'm seventeen again
Peach fuzz on my face, lookin' on the case
Tryna find a hella taste, oh, my God
I'm on the chase, Chevy, It's gettin' kinda heavy, relevant, sellin' it
Dippin' away, time keeps slippin' away
Zip in the safe, flippin' for pay
Tippin' like I'm drippin' in paint
Upfront, four blunts, like, "Khalifa put the weed in a J"

There's gon' be some weed in the air
Tell 'em, Mac
Blowin' everywhere we goin' and now you knowin'
When I step right up, get my lighter so I can light up
That's how it should be done
Soon as you thinkin' you're down
Find how to turn things around
Now things are lookin' up
From the ground up, pound up, this Taylor Gang
So turn my sound up and mount up and do my thang
Uh, now I'm chillin', fresh outta class, feelin'
Like I'm on my own and I could probably own a building
Got my own car, no job, no children
Had a science project, me and Mac killed it
T-H-C, M-A-C, D-E-V, H-D-3, high as me
This is us, we gon' fuss
And we gon' fight and we gon' roll
And live off life

You say, "I don't understand," and I say, "I know you don't"
We thought a cure would come through in time, now, I fear it won't
Remember lookin' at this room? We loved it 'cause of the light
Now, I just sit in the dark and wonder if it's time


Do I throw out everything we built or keep it?
I'm getting tired even for a phoenix
Always risin' from the ashes
Mendin' all her gashes
You might just have dealt the final blow


Stop, you're losin' me
Stop, you're losin' me
Stop, you're losin' me
I can't find a pulse
My heart won't start anymore for you
'Cause you're losin' me


Every mornin', I glared at you with storms in my eyes
How can you say that you love someone you can't tell is dyin'?
I sent you signals and bit my nails down to the quick
My face was gray, but you wouldn't admit that we were sick
You might also like
And the air is thick with loss and indecision
I know my pain is such an imposition
Now, you're runnin' down the hallway
And you know what they all say
"You don't know what you got until it's gone"


Stop, you're losin' me
Stop, you're losin' me

ज़रा-ज़रा बहकता है, महकता है आज तो मेरा तन-बदन
मैं प्यासी हूँ, मुझे भर ले अपनी बाँहों में


ज़रा-ज़रा बहकता है, महकता है आज तो मेरा तन-बदन
मैं प्यासी हूँ, मुझे भर ले अपनी बाँहों में
है मेरी क़सम तुझको, सनम, दूर कहीं ना जा
ये दूरी कहती है, "पास मेरे आजा रे"


यूँ ही बरस-बरस काली घटा बरसे
हम यार भीग जाएँ, इस चाहत की बारिश में
मेरी खुली-खुली लटों को सुलझाए
तू अपनी उँगलियों से, मैं तो हूँ इसी ख़्वाहिश में


सर्दी की रातों में हम सोए रहें इक चादर में
हम-दोनों तन्हा हो, ना कोई भी रहे इस घर में


ज़रा-ज़रा बहकता है, महकता है आज तो मेरा तन-बदन
मैं प्यासी हूँ, मुझे भर ले अपनी बाँहों में
आजा रे, आ रे


तड़पाए मुझे तेरी सभी बातें
एक बार, ऐ, दीवाने, झूठा ही सही, प्यार तो कर
मैं भूली नहीं हसीं मुलाक़ातें
बेचैन करके मुझको, मुझसे यूँ ना फ़ेर नज़र

ज़िंदगी दो पल की
ज़िंदगी दो पल की


इंतज़ार कब तक हम करेंगे भला?
तुम्हें प्यार कब तक ना करेंगे भला?
ज़िंदगी दो पल की


दिल में तुम्हारे छुपा दी है मैंने तो अपनी ये जाँ
अब तुम्हीं इसको संभालो, हमें अपना होश कहाँ
बेखुदी दो पल की, ज़िंदगी दो पल की


इंतज़ार कब तक हम करेंगे भला?
तुम्हें प्यार कब तक ना करेंगे भला?


एक छोटा सा वादा इस उम्र से ज़्यादा सच्चा है, सनम
हर मोड़ पर साथ इसलिए रहते हैं अब दोनों
दोस्ती दो पल की, ज़िंदगी दो पल की


इंतज़ार कब तक हम करेंगे भला?
तुम्हें प्यार कब तक ना करेंगे भला?
